  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process leading to the formation of sedimentary rocks begins with the accumulation of sediment, which can consist of fragments of rocks, minerals, and organic materials. Over time, these sediments are compacted together under pressure. As layers of sediment build up, the weight from the layers above presses down, compacting the particles in the lower layers. This compression, combined with the cementation process where minerals precipitate from water and act as a glue to bind the sediments together, ultimately leads to the formation of sedimentary rocks.",
