  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The natural process that leads to the breaking apart of rocks due to the expansion of water as it freezes is known as ice wedging. This occurs when water seeps into cracks in the rocks, and as temperatures drop, the water freezes and expands. The expansion of ice exerts significant pressure on the surrounding rock, leading to the widening of the cracks. With repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, the rock eventually breaks apart. This process is a key factor in weathering, contributing to the breakdown and shaping of the Earth's surface over time.",
