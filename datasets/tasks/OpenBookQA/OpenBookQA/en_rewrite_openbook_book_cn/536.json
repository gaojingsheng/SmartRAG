  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When a hurricane transitions from moving over water to moving over land, its strength decreases. This weakening occurs because hurricanes draw their power from the warm, moist air over oceans. Once they move over land, they are cut off from this source of energy, leading to a reduction in their intensity.",
