  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Natural gas is classified as a nonrenewable resource. This classification is based on its replenishment rate on Earth, which is significantly slower than the rate at which it is consumed. Nonrenewable resources, like natural gas, are formed from decomposed plants and animals, buried under layers of Earth for millions of years before they transform into the fossil fuels we use today. This long formation process means that once natural gas reserves are depleted, they cannot be quickly or easily replenished, making conservation and alternative energy sources vital for sustainable energy practices.",
