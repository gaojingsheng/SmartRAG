  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The relationship between one's proximity to urban areas and the level of light pollution experienced is directly proportional. This means that as you get closer to a city or an urban area, the amount of light pollution you experience will increase. Conversely, moving away from urban centers tends to result in a decrease in light pollution. This is due to the higher concentration of artificial light sources found in cities, such as streetlights, billboards, commercial establishments, and residential lighting, which contribute to the overall increase in ambient light at night.",
