  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Natural fibers for textile production can be obtained from various sources, including plants, animals, and minerals. Plant-based fibers, such as cotton, flax (used to make linen), hemp, jute, and bamboo, are widely used for their availability and sustainability. Animal-based fibers include wool (from sheep), silk (from silkworms), cashmere and mohair (from goats), and alpaca. There are also mineral sources such as asbestos, though its use has significantly declined due to health risks. Each source offers unique properties to the fibers, such as strength, durability, softness, and heat resistance, making them suitable for different applications in textile production.",
