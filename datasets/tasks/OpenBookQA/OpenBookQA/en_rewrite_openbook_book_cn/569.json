  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The visible trait of an organism, when it inherits different versions of a gene from each parent, is determined by the dominance relationship between those genes. If one version is stronger, or dominant, and the other is weaker, or recessive, the dominant gene will mask the effect of the recessive gene. Therefore, the trait associated with the dominant gene will be the one that is visibly expressed in the organism.",
