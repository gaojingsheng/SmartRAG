  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Brick might be a preferred material for constructing walls in homes located in areas with high electrical storm activity primarily because it acts as an effective electrical insulator. This characteristic is crucial because it helps in preventing electrical currents from passing through the walls during a storm, which can significantly enhance the safety of the occupants and the integrity of electronic devices inside the home. By using brick, which does not conduct electricity, homeowners can add an additional layer of protection against electrical surges caused by lightning, thereby reducing the risk of fire or electrical accidents within the building. This makes brick an attractive choice for construction in regions prone to frequent electrical storms.",
