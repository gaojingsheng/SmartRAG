  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Submarines detect and determine the position of underwater objects primarily through the use of sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging). Sonar systems emit sound pulses into the water, which then travel until they hit an object. Once the sound waves hit an object, they are reflected back toward the submarine. By calculating the time it takes for the echoes to return, the sonar system can determine the distance to the object. Additionally, by analyzing the strength and direction of the returning sound waves, the submarine can also determine the size, shape, and speed of the object, as well as its direction of movement. This enables submarines to navigate, avoid obstacles, identify other vessels, and detect threats under the sea.",
