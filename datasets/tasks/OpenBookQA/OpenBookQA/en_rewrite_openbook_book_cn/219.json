  "ChatGPT_response_0": "During an exothermic chemical reaction, the thermal energy of the system increases, leading to the release of heat into the surroundings. This means that the energy stored in the chemical bonds of the reactants is greater than the energy stored in the bonds of the products. As the reactants are transformed into products, the excess energy is released as heat, contributing to the warmth or heat observed in the environment where the reaction takes place. This process is characteristic of many combustion reactions, such as burning wood or fossil fuels, as well as in various metabolic processes in living organisms.",
