  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The different seasons experienced on Earth are caused by its axial tilt. The planet is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. This tilt leads to variations in the amount of sunlight different parts of the Earth receive throughout the year. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences summer due to more direct sunlight, while the Southern Hemisphere, being tilted away, experiences winter with less direct sunlight. Conversely, when the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences summer, and the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter. During the equinoxes, both hemispheres receive approximately equal amounts of sunlight, leading to spring and autumn.",
