  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Objects fall towards the surface when dropped from a height on a planet due to the force of gravity. Gravity is a fundamental force that arises due to the mass of the planet, pulling objects towards its center. Every object, including the planet itself and the object being dropped, exerts a gravitational pull on each other. However, the effect is much more pronounced from the planet due to its significantly larger mass. This force of attraction causes objects to accelerate towards the planet's surface when they are dropped.",
