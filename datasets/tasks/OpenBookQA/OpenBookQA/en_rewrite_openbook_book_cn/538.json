  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Some pets lose more hair during the summer months because shedding fur is a natural process that helps them regulate their body temperature. In warm weather, shedding excess fur allows animals to stay cooler and more comfortable. This physiological adaptation is especially common in animals with thick or heavy coats, as it reduces the amount of heat retained close to the body, making it easier for them to adapt to rising temperatures.",
