  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The Arctic region experiences low temperatures throughout most of the year primarily due to its location at high northern latitudes. This positioning results in the area receiving less direct sunlight than regions closer to the equator, leading to colder climate conditions. The angle at which sunlight hits the Arctic means that the light and heat are more diffused, contributing to the overall lower temperatures. These conditions result in temperatures that remain below 0 degrees Celsius for the majority of the year, defining the region's characteristically cold environment.",
