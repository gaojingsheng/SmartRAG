  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A substance can undergo a transition between solid, liquid, and gas states primarily due to changes in temperature. When a substance is heated, it may absorb energy, leading to an increase in the motion of its particles. This increase in particle motion can cause the substance to change from a solid to a liquid (melting) or from a liquid to a gas (vaporization). Conversely, cooling a substance can decrease the motion of its particles, promoting a change from gas to liquid (condensation) or liquid to solid (freezing). These transitions are critical to understanding various physical phenomena and processes in nature and industry.",
