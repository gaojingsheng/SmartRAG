  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The swift movement of rocks or soil down a slope, particularly following heavy rainfall, is triggered by a landslide. This occurs when the added water from rain storms saturates the soil, reducing its stability and increasing its weight, which makes it more susceptible to gravity's pull. Consequently, the weakened and heavier soil or rock mass moves downhill rapidly.",
