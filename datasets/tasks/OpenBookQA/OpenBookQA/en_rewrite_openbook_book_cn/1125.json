  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The formation of the Alps was primarily the result of rock folding. This geological process occurs when the Earth's tectonic plates move and push against each other, causing the crust to buckle and fold. Over millions of years, these movements and the subsequent folding of layers of rock led to the rise of the mountain range known today as the Alps. This process is part of the broader mechanism of mountain building, called orogeny, that involves the structural deformation of the Earth's lithosphere due to tectonic forces.",
