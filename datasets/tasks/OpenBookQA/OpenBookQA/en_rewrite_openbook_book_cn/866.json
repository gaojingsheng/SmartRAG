  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process responsible for altering the composition of substances, resulting in the formation of new materials, is known as a chemical reaction. During a chemical reaction, the reactants undergo a transformation that changes their chemical structure, leading to the production of one or more new substances, referred to as the products. This process is fundamental in chemistry and is the mechanism by which various substances interact with each other to form different compounds or materials with new properties.",
