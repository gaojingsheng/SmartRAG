  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process that contributes to the increase of organic matter in soil is decomposition. When plants, animals, and other organisms die, their bodies start to break down, thanks to the activity of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. This decomposition process converts the remains into humus, a rich organic matter that improves the fertility and water retention of the soil. As decomposition continues, it adds more organic matter to the soil, enhancing its structure and nutrient content, which in turn supports healthier plant growth.",
