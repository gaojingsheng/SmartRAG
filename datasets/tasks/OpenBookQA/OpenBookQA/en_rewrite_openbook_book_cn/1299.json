These zones are specifically designated for conservation purposes, allowing for the preservation of wildlife, plant species, and ecosystems that are of significant ecological, scientific, or cultural interest. By restricting certain human activities within these areas, such as development, logging, and mining, protected areas help maintain natural habitats and ensure the survival of diverse species.
