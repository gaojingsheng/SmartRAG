  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The appearance of the Moon changes throughout the month due to its phases. These phases occur because of the Moon's orbit around the Earth, which results in varying amounts of the Moon being illuminated by the Sun, from our perspective on Earth. As the Moon moves through its approximately 29.5-day lunar cycle, we see different portions of its sunlit side, ranging from a new moon (when the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun and thus mostly invisible from Earth) to a full moon (when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, and the Moon's disk is fully illuminated) and every phase in between. This cycle of phases repeats each month, causing the Moon to visibly change from night to night.",
