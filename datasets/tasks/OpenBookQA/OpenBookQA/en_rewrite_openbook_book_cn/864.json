  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The days are longer during the summer season because the Earth's tilt on its axis causes the sun's rays to hit the Earth at a more direct angle in the hemisphere experiencing summer. This tilt towards the sun increases the amount of daylight hours, making days longer. In summer, the Earth's axis in the relevant hemisphere (Northern or Southern) is tilted toward the sun, resulting in increased daylight due to the sun taking a longer path across the sky. Consequently, this leads to longer periods of daylight compared to other seasons.",
