  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When a flame is applied directly to a candle wick, the heat from the flame melts the wax around the wick. This melted wax is then drawn up the wick by capillary action. When this wax vaporizes, it reacts with oxygen in the air to ignite and produce a steady flame. This process allows the candle to continue burning, consuming the wax and wick over time to produce light and heat.",
