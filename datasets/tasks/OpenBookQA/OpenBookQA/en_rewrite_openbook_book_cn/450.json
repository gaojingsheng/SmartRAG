  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process that leads to the folding of rock layers over each other is primarily associated with the stress and pressure conditions found in the Earth's crust, which can be significantly influenced by seismic activities such as earthquakes. When the Earth's tectonic plates move and interact, they can generate immense pressure, causing the layers of rock to bend, fold, and sometimes even break. This movement and the resulting stress are what lead to the folding of rock layers, creating various geological structures such as anticlines and synclines. Earthquakes are a notable trigger for such processes, as they can abruptly shift rock layers, pushing some to fold over others in response to the applied forces.",
