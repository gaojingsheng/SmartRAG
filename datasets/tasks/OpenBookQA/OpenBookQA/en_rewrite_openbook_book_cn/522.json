  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Temperature indicates the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance. When we refer to the temperature of an object, we're essentially discussing how vigorously its atoms or molecules are moving. In substances at higher temperatures, particles move more rapidly, implying a greater amount of kinetic energy. Conversely, at lower temperatures, particles move less vigorously, indicating lesser kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is a crucial component of the substance's internal energy, which is related to its heat energy. Thus, temperature serves as an indirect measure of the internal energy present within a substance, which is why it is often associated with the concept of heat energy.",
