  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When a new predator species is introduced into an ecosystem and begins consuming a specific prey species, the likely outcome is a decrease in the population size of that prey species. This change occurs because the prey species faces increased mortality rates due to predation, leading to a decline in their numbers if the rate of predation exceeds their ability to reproduce and replenish their population.",
