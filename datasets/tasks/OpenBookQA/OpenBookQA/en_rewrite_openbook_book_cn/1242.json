  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The function of an electrical insulator in controlling electrical currents is to limit or prevent the flow of electricity through it. Unlike conductors which allow electricity to pass through easily, insulators resist the flow, thereby acting as a barrier or protector to control where electricity can or cannot go. This property is crucial for safely containing electrical currents within designated paths, preventing unintended electrical shock or short circuits, and ensuring that electrical devices and networks operate safely and efficiently.",
