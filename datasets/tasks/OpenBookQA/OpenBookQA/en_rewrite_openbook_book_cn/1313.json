  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When a substance undergoes a phase change, such as from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas, its mass remains unaffected. This means that regardless of the state the substance is in—solid, liquid, or gas—its mass will stay the same before and after the transition. This principle is fundamental in understanding matter conservation during phase changes.",
