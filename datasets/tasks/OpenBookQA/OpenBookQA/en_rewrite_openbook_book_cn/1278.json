  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Certain objects are more visible in low-light conditions compared to others primarily because they are better at reflecting light. Objects that have surfaces which can reflect a greater amount of light that falls on them stand out more in dim conditions. This is because our ability to see an object depends on the light rays it reflects into our eyes. The more light an object reflects, the easier it is for our eyes to detect it against a dark background. Reflectivity varies with different materials and surfaces; for example, light-colored and shiny surfaces tend to reflect more light and thus are more visible in low-light environments.",
