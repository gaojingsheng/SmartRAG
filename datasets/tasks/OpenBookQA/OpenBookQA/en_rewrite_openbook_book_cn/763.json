  "ChatGPT_response_0": "If a cell lacks the ability to differentiate into specialized forms, it becomes responsible for carrying out all the necessary functions required for life on its own. This means that instead of having a division of labor seen in organisms with specialized cells, this cell must independently handle multiple tasks. These tasks include obtaining nutrients, disposing of waste, reproduction, and responding to environmental changes, among other essential life processes. The absence of specialization can limit the efficiency and adaptability of the cell, affecting its survival and functionality within a larger organism or ecosystem.",
