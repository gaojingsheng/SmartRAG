  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When an object undergoes a chemical change, it results in the formation of one or more new substances, each with new chemical properties. This means the original substance has been altered at a molecular level, leading to changes in its chemical behavior and interactions. The new chemical properties could include changes in color, smell, reactivity with other chemicals, and phase (solid, liquid, gas) under various conditions, among others. Essentially, the intrinsic nature of the substance is changed, making it chemically distinct from what it was prior to the reaction.",
