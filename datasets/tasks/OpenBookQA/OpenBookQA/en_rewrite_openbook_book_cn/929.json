  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A white object appears white to the human eye because it reflects all wavelengths of visible light. When light hits an object, the object can absorb or reflect the light. In the case of a white object, instead of absorbing light, it reflects all the visible light wavelengths back to the observer. Since visible light is composed of all colors, and a white object reflects all of these colors equally, it appears white to us. This ability to reflect all wavelengths of visible light makes it distinctive in the way we perceive its color.",
