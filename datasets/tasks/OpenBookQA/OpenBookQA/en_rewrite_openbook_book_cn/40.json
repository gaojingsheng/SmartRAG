  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A cell maintains its structure primarily through its cell membrane, which acts as a support system for the entire cell. This membrane is not just a barrier to the external environment but also plays a crucial role in holding the cell's components in place, providing a stable environment for the biochemical processes vital for life. The structural integrity of the cell is thus closely tied to the proper functioning and maintenance of the cell membrane.",
