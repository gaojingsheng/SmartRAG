  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process of weathering, which significantly affects landscapes or geological features, usually takes place over a period of many years. This process can vary in duration, depending on the type of weathering (chemical, physical, or biological), the nature of the material being weathered, and the environmental conditions. In some cases, noticeable changes might be observed over decades, while in others, it might take centuries or even longer for substantial transformations to occur. Weathering is a gradual and continuous process that contributes to the shaping and altering of the Earth's surface over time.",
