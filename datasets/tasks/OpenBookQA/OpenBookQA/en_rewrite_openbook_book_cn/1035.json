  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When an object is struck by another, the particles within the struck object begin to vibrate. This vibration stems from the kinetic energy transferred from the impacting object to the particles of the struck object. These vibrations can manifest as sound, heat, or deformation of the object, depending on the intensity of the impact and the material properties of the objects involved.",
