  "ChatGPT_response_0": "To ensure a conductor is adequately protected to prevent electrical leakage, it must be insulated properly. This process involves wrapping the conductor in a material that serves as an insulator. Insulation materials are specifically chosen for their ability to resist the flow of electric current, thus preventing leakage and ensuring safe and efficient operation of electrical systems. This protective layer not only safeguards against unwanted electrical discharge but also protects people from potential electric shocks and the system from short circuits and other electrical faults. Proper insulation is crucial for the durability and safety of electrical installations.",
