  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The phenomenon that occurs when light changes direction as it passes from one medium to another is known as refraction. This bending of light happens because the speed of light changes as it moves from one medium to another, such as from air into water or from water into glass. The change in speed results in a change in direction of the light wave, causing it to refract.",
