  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A white object appears white to the human eye because it reflects all visible wavelengths of light. When light hits an object, the way it interacts with the object's surface determines the color we perceive. In the case of a white object, since all wavelengths are reflected equally, none are absorbed or filtered out. This means all colors of the visible spectrum are reflected back to our eyes simultaneously. Our brain interprets this combination of all visible light wavelengths being reflected together as the color white.",
