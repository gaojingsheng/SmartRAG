  "ChatGPT_response_0": "An example of a natural process that leads to the breakdown of rocks over time, particularly involving the growth of plant life, is biological weathering. This occurs when plant roots grow into the cracks within rocks. As the roots expand and deepen, they exert physical force on the rock, gradually causing it to fracture and break apart. This form of weathering highlights the powerful influence of living organisms on the geology of their environment.",
