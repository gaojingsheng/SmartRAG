  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The primary reason we observe different constellations in the sky at various times of the year is due to the Earth's revolution around the sun. As the Earth orbits the Sun, our line of sight towards space shifts, causing different stars and constellations to become visible at different times. This orbital motion means that the section of the night sky we can observe from Earth changes throughout the year, thus presenting us with a variety of constellations to enjoy as the months pass.",
