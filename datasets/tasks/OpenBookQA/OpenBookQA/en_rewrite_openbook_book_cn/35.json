  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The North Star, or Polaris, appears to maintain its position in the sky throughout the night in the Northern Hemisphere due to its unique position almost directly above Earth's rotational axis. As the Earth spins on its axis, stars in the night sky appear to move in circles around the celestial poles. However, since Polaris is located nearly at the North celestial pole, it stands almost motionless in the sky, with all other stars appearing to rotate around it. This apparent immobility is why Polaris has been used for navigation for centuries, providing a fixed point in the sky to determine direction.",
