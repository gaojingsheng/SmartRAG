  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The phenomenon responsible for the change in seasons experienced by various regions of the world throughout the year is the Earth's axial tilt. This tilt, about 23.5 degrees from the plane of its orbit around the Sun, causes the Earth's hemispheres to receive varying amounts of sunlight over the course of a year. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, it experiences warmer temperatures and summer, while the Southern Hemisphere, tilted away, experiences winter, and vice versa. This variation in solar energy received by different parts of the Earth's surface at different times of the year is what leads to the seasons.",
