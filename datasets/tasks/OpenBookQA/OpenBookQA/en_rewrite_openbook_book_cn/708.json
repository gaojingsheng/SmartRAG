  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When the battery of an electromagnet is switched on, the nail within the electromagnet becomes magnetic. This occurs due to the electric current passing through the wire of the electromagnet, which creates a magnetic field around the wire. This magnetic field magnetizes the nail, allowing it to attract other ferromagnetic materials.",
