  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Wood is commonly used in the handles of tools meant for working with electrical installations because it is an excellent insulator of electrical energy. This property helps protect the user from electric shocks by preventing the flow of electrical current from the tool to the person holding it. This insulating characteristic of wood makes it a safe material choice for tool handles, ensuring additional safety measures for electricians and other professionals working with or around electrical installations.",
