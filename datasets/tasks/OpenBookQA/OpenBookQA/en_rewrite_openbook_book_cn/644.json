  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A rocket engine generates the force necessary to propel a spacecraft forward through a principle known as Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the context of a rocket engine, this means that when gases are expelled out of the back of the engine at high speed, the rocket itself is pushed forward in the opposite direction with equal force. This force is what propels the spacecraft forward. The high-speed expulsion of gases is achieved by the combustion of rocket fuel, which produces a large volume of gas and propels it through the rocket’s nozzle, generating thrust. This thrust is what overcomes the gravitational pull of the Earth (or any celestial body from which the spacecraft is departing) and any atmospheric drag, propelling the spacecraft into space.",
