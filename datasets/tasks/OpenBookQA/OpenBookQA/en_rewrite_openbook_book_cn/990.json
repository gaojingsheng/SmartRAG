  "ChatGPT_response_0": "If an organism's body temperature falls significantly below its survival threshold, it can lead to the organism's death. This is because the bodily functions critical for survival are highly temperature-dependent. Temperature plays a crucial role in enzymatic activities, metabolic processes, and overall physiological functions. When the temperature drops too low, these processes can slow down dramatically or even stop, leading to organ failure and eventually death if the condition is not swiftly corrected.",
