  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A thermal energy conductor functions based on the principle of heat transfer, moving thermal energy from objects at a higher temperature to those at a lower temperature. This process continues until thermal equilibrium is achieved, meaning the objects involved reach the same temperature. The efficiency and speed of this heat transfer depend on the material's thermal conductivity, with metals typically being good conductors due to their ability to rapidly transfer heat compared to non-metallic or insulating materials.",
  "query": "How does a thermal energy conductor function in terms of heat transfer between objects of different temperatures?",
