  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process that can cause a substance to transition between solid, liquid, and gas phases involves the application or removal of heat. When heat is applied to a solid, it can melt into a liquid, and if more heat is added, the liquid can vaporize into a gas. Conversely, cooling a gas can condense it into a liquid, and further cooling can solidify the liquid into a solid. These transitions are known as phase changes, and they occur because heat energy affects the motion and arrangement of molecules within a substance. With enough heat, the increased molecular motion overcomes the forces holding the molecules together in a solid or liquid state, leading to a change to a less structured phase.",
