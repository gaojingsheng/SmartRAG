  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process responsible for a magnet's ability to draw in materials made of magnetic metals is called magnetism. This physical phenomenon is mediated by a magnetic field, which exerts a force on other materials, particularly those that are ferromagnetic (like iron, cobalt, and nickel). These materials are attracted to the magnet, allowing them to be drawn in by the magnetic force.",
