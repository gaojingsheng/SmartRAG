  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When objects are left outdoors during daylight hours, they are exposed to sunlight. This exposure can lead to various effects on the objects depending on the material they are made from, the duration of exposure, and the intensity of the sunlight. Sunlight is composed of ultraviolet (UV) rays, visible light, and infrared radiation, which can cause materials to fade, heat up, or undergo chemical changes. For example, prolonged exposure to sunlight can fade the colors of fabrics and plastics, weaken or degrade materials like rubber and wood, and cause metals to become hot or even warp over time if the conditions are extreme. Additionally, sunlight can play a beneficial role in disinfecting and drying objects, making it a natural method to reduce moisture and inhibit the growth of molds, mildews, and bacteria on various surfaces.",
