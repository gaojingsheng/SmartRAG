  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Stars emit light through a process called nuclear fusion that takes place in their cores. In this process, hydrogen atoms under immense pressure and temperature combine to form helium, releasing a vast amount of energy in the form of light and heat. This emitted light is what we see when we look at stars in the night sky. Through nuclear fusion, stars are able to shine for billions of years, converting mass into energy as described by Einstein’s equation, E=mc^2.",
