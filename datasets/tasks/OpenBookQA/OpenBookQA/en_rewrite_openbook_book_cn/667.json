  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The formation of coal from peat in swamp environments is a complex process that occurs over millions of years. Initially, vast amounts of plant material accumulate in swampy areas, creating thick layers of peat. As the peat is buried under further layers of soil and sediment, it experiences an increase in heat and pressure. This transformation, driven by the geological conditions, compacts the peat and gradually changes its chemical and physical properties. Over time, through this process of extreme heat and pressure, the peat gets converted into coal, a process that is both gradual and requires vast spans of geological time.",
