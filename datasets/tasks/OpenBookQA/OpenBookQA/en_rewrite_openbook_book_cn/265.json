  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process of decomposition significantly impacts the content of organic matter in soil by breaking down dead plant and animal materials into simpler substances. This breakdown is facilitated by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, which feed on the dead matter, thereby decomposing it. As decomposition occurs, the amount of organic matter in the soil increases. This is because the process releases nutrients stored in dead organisms back into the soil, enriching it. The organic matter that results from decomposition improves the soil structure, increases its water retention capacity, and enhances its fertility, making it more conducive for plant growth.",
