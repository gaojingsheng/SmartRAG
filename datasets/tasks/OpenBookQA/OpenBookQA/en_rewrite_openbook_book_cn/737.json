  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The geological process that results in the folding of rock layers upon one another is primarily associated with the tectonic activity during earthquakes. When the Earth's tectonic plates shift and move, the intense pressure applied to the rock layers causes them to bend and fold. This is a key process in the formation of mountain ranges and various geological structures around the planet.",
