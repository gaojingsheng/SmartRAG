  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The property that allows a balloon to expand when air is added is related to the nature of gases. Because matter in the gas phase has a variable volume, when air (which is a mixture of gases) is pumped into a balloon, the volume of the air adjusts to fill the available space. As more air is added, the gas particles move further apart, exerting pressure against the inner walls of the balloon, which leads to the expansion of the balloon. This characteristic of gases—to expand or compress in response to changes in pressure and volume—underpins the behavior observed when filling a balloon.",
