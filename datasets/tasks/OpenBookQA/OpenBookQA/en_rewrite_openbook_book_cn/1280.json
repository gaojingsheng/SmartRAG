  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The Earth receives solar energy from the sun primarily through sunlight. This sunlight, composed of various forms of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation, travels through the vacuum of space to reach our planet. Once this energy arrives at Earth, it heats the planet's surface, drives weather patterns, supports plant life through photosynthesis, and provides the foundational energy necessary for virtually all ecological systems.",
