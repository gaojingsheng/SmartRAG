  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The most common impact on native wildlife when human populations expand into new areas is the loss of habitat for native species. This occurs because the land that was once available and suitable for these species' homes, feeding, and breeding grounds is transformed into areas for housing, agriculture, infrastructure, and other human activities. As a result, wildlife may face significant declines in population due to the reduced availability of their natural habitats.",
