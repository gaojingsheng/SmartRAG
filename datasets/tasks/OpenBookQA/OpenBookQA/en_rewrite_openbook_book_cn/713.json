  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A rainbow forms during or after rainfall due to the process of sunlight refracting, or bending, as it passes through water droplets in the atmosphere. When sunlight enters a water droplet, each color in the light spectrum bends at a slightly different angle due to the change in speed when moving from air into the denser water. This separation causes the light to spread out into its constituent colors, creating the spectrum we see as a rainbow. Each color exits the droplet at its own unique angle, allowing the observer to see the array of colors arranged as a circular arc in the sky, with the conditions being just right—such as having the sun behind the observer and rain droplets in front.",
