  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The temperature of a wire increases when it is part of an electrical circuit because the electrical current running through the wire generates heat. This phenomenon is a result of the electrical resistance of the wire, which opposes the flow of electrons. As electrons move through the wire, they collide with the atoms in the metal, causing these atoms to vibrate more, which increases the temperature of the wire. This effect is widely known as Joule heating or resistive heating.",
