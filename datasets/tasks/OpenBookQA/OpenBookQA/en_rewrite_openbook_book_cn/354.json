  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Inside a bubble, there is gas that allows it to maintain its shape and float. The surface tension of the liquid surrounding the gas causes the bubble to form into a nearly spherical shape, as the sphere provides the least surface area for a given volume, leading to a minimization of energy. The gas inside the bubble is typically air, but can be other gases as well. This gas is less dense than the surrounding liquid, which makes the bubble buoyant and allows it to float.",
