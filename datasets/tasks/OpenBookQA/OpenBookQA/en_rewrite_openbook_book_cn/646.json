  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Most canyons are typically formed by the process of erosion, where flowing rivers cut through the Earth's crust over long periods of time. This erosion occurs as the water flow removes soil and rock, gradually deepening and widening the canyon. The process is slow, often taking thousands to millions of years, depending on the size of the canyon and the nature of its geological features. The constant movement of water, along with varying factors such as the type of rock, regional climate, and topography, contributes to the unique shape and size of each canyon.",
