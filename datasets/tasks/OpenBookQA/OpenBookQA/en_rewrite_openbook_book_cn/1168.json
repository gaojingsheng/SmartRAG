  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Objects appear to decrease in size as they move further away from you because of the way our visual perception works. This phenomenon is related to the principles of perspective, which dictate that as an object's distance from the observer increases, the angle of vision decreases. Consequently, the image formed on your retina is smaller, leading your brain to interpret the object as being smaller. This is a fundamental aspect of how we perceive depth and distance, helping us navigate and understand the spatial relationships in our environment.",
