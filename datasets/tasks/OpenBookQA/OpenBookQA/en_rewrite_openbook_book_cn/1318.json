  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The relationship between a vehicle's fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (MPG), and its total consumption of gasoline is inversely proportional. This means that as a vehicle's MPG rating increases, indicating greater fuel efficiency, the quantity of gasoline it consumes over a given distance decreases. Conversely, a lower MPG rating signifies lower fuel efficiency and results in higher gasoline consumption for the same distance traveled. Therefore, vehicles with higher MPG ratings are more fuel-efficient and use less gasoline, contributing to both lower fuel costs and reduced environmental impact through decreased emissions.",
