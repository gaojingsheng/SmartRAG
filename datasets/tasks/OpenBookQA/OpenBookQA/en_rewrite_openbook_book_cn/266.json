  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The key distinction between a plant cell and an animal cell in terms of organelles responsible for photosynthesis lies in the presence of chloroplasts in plant cells. Chloroplasts are specialized organelles found in plant cells (and also in some algae) that conduct photosynthesis. They capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy through a process that ultimately produces glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Animal cells lack chloroplasts and thus do not have the capacity to perform photosynthesis.",
