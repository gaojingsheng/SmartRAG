  "ChatGPT_response_0": "An object or material that conducts thermal energy is known as a thermal conductor. These materials have the capability to transfer heat from one area to another due to their molecular structure, which allows for the free movement of energy. Common examples include metals like copper, aluminum, and silver, which are often used in applications requiring efficient heat transfer, such as in cookware, heat sinks, and radiators.",
