  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Craters on planetary surfaces and moons are predominantly formed by the impact of asteroids. When these space rocks collide with a planet or moon, their immense velocity combined with the force of impact creates a significant depression or crater on the surface. This process has contributed to the varied cratered landscapes observed on many celestial bodies within our solar system.",
