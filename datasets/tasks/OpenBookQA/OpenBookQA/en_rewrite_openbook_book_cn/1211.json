  "ChatGPT_response_0": "In coal-fired power stations, electricity is primarily generated by burning coal. The process involves igniting coal to heat water in boilers, producing steam. This high-pressure steam then drives turbines connected to electric generators, converting the kinetic energy into electrical energy. This method is widely used due to coal's abundance and economic feasibility, although it raises environmental concerns due to the emissions produced during combustion.",
