In addition, rabbits may also eat fruits and vegetables, though these should be given in moderation to avoid digestive issues. The bulk of a domestic rabbit's diet should be composed of high-quality hay, which aids in their digestion and helps wear down their continuously growing teeth. Fresh water should always be available as well.",
