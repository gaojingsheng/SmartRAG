  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Sound waves are transmitted through mediums such as air, enabling humans to hear various noises in their environment. This is because sound waves are mechanical waves that require a medium to travel through, and air, being elastic and compressible, facilitates the propagation of these waves. When sound waves travel through air, they cause vibrations of the air molecules, which, in turn, create the sensation of sound when these vibrations reach the human ear.",
