  "ChatGPT_response_0": "In coal-fired power stations, electricity is generated by burning coal. When coal is burned, the chemical energy stored in its bonds is released as heat. This heat is used to turn water into steam in boilers. The high-pressure steam then drives turbines, which are connected to generators. As the turbines spin, the generators convert the mechanical energy from the turbines into electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. This electrical energy can then be transported through the power grid to homes, businesses, and other facilities that need electricity.",
