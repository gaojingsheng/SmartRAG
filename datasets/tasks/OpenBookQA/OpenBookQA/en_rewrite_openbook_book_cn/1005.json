  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The properties that do not depend on the amount of matter, known as intensive properties, remain unaffected by changes in temperature because they are inherent to the substance's nature. Unlike extensive properties, which depend on the amount of matter present and can change with variations in size or quantity (for example, mass or volume), intensive properties, such as density, boiling point, and refractive index, are characteristic of the substance's identity and do not vary with the amount of substance or, in this context, with temperature changes. This means that the fundamental characteristics of the substance that dictate these properties are not altered by temperature adjustments. Essentially, the molecular or atomic structure that determines these properties remains constant, irrespective of thermal energy inputs or outputs.",
