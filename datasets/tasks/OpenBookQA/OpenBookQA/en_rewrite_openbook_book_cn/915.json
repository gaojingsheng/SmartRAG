  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The strength of gravitational pull that a celestial body exerts is directly related to its mass. Since the Earth has significantly more mass than the Moon, it has a stronger gravitational pull. This means that objects near the Earth are attracted more strongly towards it compared to objects that are near the Moon.",
