  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When salt is added to water and dissolves, the solution acquires a salty taste because the water now contains dissolved salt particles. These particles interact with the taste receptors on the tongue, specifically the receptors sensitive to sodium ions, which are components of salt (sodium chloride). As a result, the presence of salt in water changes its taste profile to salty.",
