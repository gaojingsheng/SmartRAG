It can enhance the organism's ability to perform daily activities, improve its metabolic efficiency, and potentially increase its lifespan by reducing the risk of diseases and injuries. Stronger muscles can lead to better balance, coordination, and posture, which in turn can help prevent falls and related injuries. Additionally, having greater strength can improve an individual's mental health by boosting self-esteem and reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.
