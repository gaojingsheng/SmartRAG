  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Viruses present within an object can be effectively eliminated by applying heat to the object. Heating an object to an appropriate temperature for a sufficient duration can inactivate or destroy viruses, rendering them non-infectious. This method is widely used for sterilization and disinfection in various settings, including medical and food preparation environments. The exact temperature and time required can vary depending on the type of virus and object involved, but the underlying principle is that heat disrupts the virus's structure and vital functions, leading to its inactivation.",
