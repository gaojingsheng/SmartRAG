  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The days feel shorter during the winter season primarily due to the decreased amount of daylight. As the Earth orbits the sun, the tilt of the planet's axis leads to variations in the angle at which sunlight reaches different parts of the Earth throughout the year. During winter months, the hemisphere experiencing winter is tilted away from the sun, resulting in shorter daylight hours. This tilt limits the duration of sunlight each day, making daytime appear significantly shorter compared to other seasons.",
