  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Nerves function as the critical components of the nervous system that transmit signals between the brain and the rest of the body. They play an essential role in sensing external stimuli, such as temperature and physical touch, through specialized nerve endings found in the skin. When these nerve endings are stimulated by changes in temperature or by physical contact, they generate electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted via the nerves to the brain, where they are interpreted as sensations of heat, cold, or touch. This process allows the body to respond appropriately to its environment, protecting it from potential harm and enhancing the perception of the world around it.",
