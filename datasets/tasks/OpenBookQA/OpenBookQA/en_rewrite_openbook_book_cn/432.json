  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Insects that develop into adults without going through a pupal stage undergo a process known as incomplete metamorphosis. This developmental process involves three key stages: egg, nymph, and adult. After hatching from the egg, the insect emerges as a nymph, which resembles a smaller version of the adult but typically lacks fully developed wings and reproductive organs. Through successive molts, the nymph gradually grows larger and undergoes subtle transformations until it reaches its adult form. Unlike complete metamorphosis, where the insect undergoes a dramatic transformation within a pupal stage, in incomplete metamorphosis, the transition from nymph to adult is more gradual and does not involve a pupal stage. This strategy allows these insects to remain active and continue to feed and grow throughout their development.",
