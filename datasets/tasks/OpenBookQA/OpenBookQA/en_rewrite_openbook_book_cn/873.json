Essentially, when less of the resource is used, it depletes at a slower rate, allowing it to last longer. This can contribute to sustainability and ensure that future generations will also have access to this resource. The principle behind this is straightforward; by conserving and using resources more efficiently, we reduce the pressure on these natural assets, which can help in preserving them for a longer duration.",
