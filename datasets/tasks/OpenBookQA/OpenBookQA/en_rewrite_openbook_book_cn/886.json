  "ChatGPT_response_0": "In cold climates, a key process that contributes to the breaking apart of rocks is known as ice wedging. This occurs when water seeps into cracks and openings within rocks and then freezes. As water freezes, it expands, exerting significant outward pressure on the surrounding rock. This expansion can cause the rock to crack and eventually break apart. This process is a common form of physical weathering in environments where the temperature fluctuates around the freezing point of water, allowing it to repeatedly freeze and thaw. Ice wedging can lead to the formation of larger fractures and crevices over time, contributing to the gradual disintegration of rock structures in cold climates.",
