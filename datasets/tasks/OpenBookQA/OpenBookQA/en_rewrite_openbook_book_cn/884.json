Animals often exhibit specific patterns, vibrant colors, or distinctive markings that not only distinguish them from other species but also make them more appealing to members of the opposite sex within their species. This use of color can signal genetic fitness, health, and the ability to produce viable offspring, thus influencing mate selection.
