  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The likelihood of a child inheriting a specific trait from their parents is determined using a genetic tool known as a Punnett square. This approach allows for the calculation of the percentage chance that an offspring will receive a particular trait from each parent. The Punnett square method involves mapping out all the possible combinations of alleles (variations of a gene) that the parents can pass on to their child. By doing so, one can visually represent the potential genetic outcomes and, subsequently, compute the probabilities of the offspring inheriting traits such as eye color, hair color, or even certain genetic disorders.",
