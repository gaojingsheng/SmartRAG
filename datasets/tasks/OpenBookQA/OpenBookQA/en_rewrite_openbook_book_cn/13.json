  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Electromagnets can be activated to generate a magnetic field by applying electricity to them. When an electric current flows through the wire of the electromagnet, it creates a magnetic field around it. The strength of this magnetic field can be adjusted by changing the amount of electric current flowing through the wire.",
