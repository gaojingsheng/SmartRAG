  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process that describes the breaking down of rocks through physical methods rather than by chemical change is known as mechanical weathering. This involves the physical breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces without altering the chemical composition of the minerals within the rocks. It can be caused by various factors such as temperature changes leading to expansion and contraction, freeze-thaw cycles, salt crystal growth, or the action of roots and biological activity. These processes can significantly contribute to the overall weathering and erosion of rocks in nature.",
