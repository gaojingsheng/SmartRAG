  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A single-cell organism is incapable of performing a variety of complex tasks compared to multicellular organisms largely because it lacks the ability to specialize. In multicellular organisms, different cells can take on specialized functions, such as carrying oxygen, absorbing nutrients, or defending against pathogens. This specialization allows for a division of labor among cells, making the organism as a whole more efficient and capable of performing a wide range of complex tasks. In contrast, a single-cell organism must carry out all necessary functions for survival within that one cell, limiting its ability to handle complex tasks that require specialized functions. This inherent limitation means single-cell organisms cannot achieve the same level of complexity in terms of functionality as their multicellular counterparts.",
