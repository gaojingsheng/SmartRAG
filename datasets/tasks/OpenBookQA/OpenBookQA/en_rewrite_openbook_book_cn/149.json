  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Birds are warm-blooded creatures, meaning they maintain a constant body temperature regardless of the external environment. This type of blood regulation allows them to adapt to various climates and conditions, enabling them to inhabit a wide range of environments across the globe. Warm-bloodedness, or endothermy, gives birds the ability to regulate their body heat through metabolic processes, making it possible for them to remain active and efficient in both cold and hot conditions. This characteristic is crucial for their survival, as it aids in flight, foraging, and evading predators in diverse weather situations.",
