  "ChatGPT_response_0": "An example of a chemical change involving the reaction between substances is the process where an acid reacts with a substance, leading to its breakdown. This reaction typically results in the formation of new substances as the acid interacts with the other material, altering its chemical composition. Common examples include hydrochloric acid reacting with calcium carbonate to produce calcium chloride, water, and carbon dioxide gas. This kind of reaction demonstrates a fundamental chemical change, characterized by the rearrangement of atoms and the creation of new chemical bonds, resulting in products that have different properties from the reactants.",
