  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process of forming fossil fuels typically takes around 300 million years. This duration is vastly beyond the scale of human perception of time, as it exceeds human lifespans and even the entirety of human history by several orders of magnitude. Humans tend to measure time in terms of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, and perhaps generations, but the formation of fossil fuels stretches over millions of years, making it hard for humans to fully grasp the sheer length of time involved in this natural process.",
