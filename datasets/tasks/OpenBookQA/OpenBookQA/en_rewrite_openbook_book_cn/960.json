  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Domestic pets like dogs and cats often stay away from areas or objects with strong, unpleasant smells because these odors are generally perceived as indicators of potential danger or harm. Strong, unpleasant smells can signal the presence of toxins, harmful substances, or spoiled food, all of which could pose health risks to the animal. Additionally, the advanced olfactory senses in dogs and cats make them particularly sensitive to smell, allowing them to detect and therefore avoid unpleasant or harmful odors more effectively than humans can. This behavior is instinctual, helping them to protect themselves from ingesting or coming into contact with potentially dangerous substances.",
