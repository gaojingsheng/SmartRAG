  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The natural phenomenon primarily responsible for the alternating patterns of daylight and darkness on Earth is the rotation of the Earth on its axis. As the Earth rotates, different parts of the planet are exposed to the Sun, resulting in daylight. Conversely, when any part of the Earth is turned away from the Sun, it experiences darkness, leading to night. This continuous rotation leads to the regular cycle of day and night experienced across the globe.",
