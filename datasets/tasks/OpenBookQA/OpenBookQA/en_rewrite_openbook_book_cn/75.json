  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Animals hang their tongues out of their mouths when it gets hot primarily as a mechanism to regulate their body temperature. This behavior, known as panting, allows them to expel heat by evaporating water from the surface of their tongues and upper respiratory tract. As air moves over the moist surfaces, it helps in cooling them down through evaporation. Since many animals have fewer sweat glands compared to humans, panting is an essential physiological response to prevent overheating and maintain their body temperature within a safe range during hot conditions.",
