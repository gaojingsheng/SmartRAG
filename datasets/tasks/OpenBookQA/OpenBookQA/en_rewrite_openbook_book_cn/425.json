  "ChatGPT_response_0": "One significant source of environmental pollution related to agricultural practices is the use of fertilizers. These substances, while essential for enhancing crop growth and productivity, can lead to the contamination of soil, water bodies, and air. The runoff of excess nutrients from fertilizers into rivers, lakes, and coastal waters can result in eutrophication, a condition that leads to the excessive growth of algae. This process depletes oxygen in the water, harming aquatic life and affecting the quality of water for human use. Additionally, some fertilizers release harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Thus, while beneficial for agriculture, the misuse or overuse of fertilizers poses significant environmental risks.",
