  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The human body ensures that oxygen from inhaled air reaches the bloodstream primarily through the process of gas exchange in the lungs. This occurs in the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs within the lungs where blood is brought close to the inhaled air but separated by a very thin barrier. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through this barrier into the blood due to the higher concentration of oxygen in the air compared to the bloodstream. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism in body cells, moves from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled. This efficient exchange mechanism allows oxygen to be continuously supplied to the bloodstream, where it can be transported to all parts of the body to sustain cellular functions.",
