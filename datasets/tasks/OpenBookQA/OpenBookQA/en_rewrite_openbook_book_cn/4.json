  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Animals exhibit certain behaviors immediately after birth without being taught due to innate instincts. These instincts are behaviors that are hardwired into an animal's brain, allowing it to perform complex actions without prior instruction or experience. This capability ensures their survival, aiding in crucial activities such as finding food, defending themselves from predators, and, in some species, moving or communicating. These instinctual behaviors are a result of evolutionary processes, where traits and behaviors that enhance an animal's chances of survival and reproduction are favored and thus become ingrained in the species over generations.",
