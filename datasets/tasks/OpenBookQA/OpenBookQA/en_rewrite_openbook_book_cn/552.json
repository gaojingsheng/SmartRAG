  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The nervous system transmits signals throughout the body using a combination of electrical and chemical processes. Neurons, the cells that make up the nervous system, communicate with each other through these signals. The process begins when a neuron is stimulated, leading to a change in its electrical charge, creating an electrical impulse known as an action potential. This action potential travels along the neuron’s axon until it reaches the synapse, the junction between two neurons.\n\nAt the synapse, the electrical signal triggers the release of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters from the presynaptic neuron. These neurotransmitters cross the synaptic gap and bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing a change in the electrical charge of the postsynaptic neuron. If the signal is strong enough, it can initiate another action potential in this neuron, continuing the transmission of the signal.\n\nThis process of electrical and chemical signaling allows the nervous system to rapidly transmit signals over long distances across the body, enabling complex functions such as movement, thought, sensation, and response to the environment.",
