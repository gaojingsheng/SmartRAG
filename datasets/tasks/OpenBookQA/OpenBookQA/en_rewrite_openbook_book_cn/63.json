  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Plants obtain the necessary nutrients for their growth primarily through their root systems. The roots absorb minerals and nutrients dissolved in water from the soil. This process allows plants to access the essential elements they need for various physiological activities, including growth, development, and reproduction. The nutrients absorbed include both macronutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are required in larger quantities, and micronutrients, like iron, manganese, and zinc, needed in smaller amounts. This nutrient uptake is facilitated by the root's ability to selectively absorb what is needed and transport it to other parts of the plant.",
