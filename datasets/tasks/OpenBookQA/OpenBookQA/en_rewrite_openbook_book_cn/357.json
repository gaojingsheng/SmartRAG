  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The increase in light pollution significantly impairs our ability to observe celestial bodies at night. As artificial light from cities, buildings, streets, and other sources brightens the night sky, it creates a glow that can overwhelm the faint light of stars, planets, and other celestial objects. This makes the night sky appear less dark, reducing the contrast between the stars and the sky itself, and thus, many stars and celestial phenomena that would otherwise be visible to the naked eye or through telescopes become much harder, if not impossible, to see. This degradation of night sky visibility not only affects amateur stargazing and professional astronomical research but also disrupts the natural rhythms of both humans and wildlife that rely on the patterns of the night sky.",
