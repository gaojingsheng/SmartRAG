  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The primary reason Pluto is classified as a dwarf planet instead of a full-fledged planet is because it has not cleared its orbit. According to the definition set by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006, for a celestial body to be considered a planet, it must orbit the Sun, be spherical in shape due to its own gravity, and have cleared its orbit of other debris. Pluto meets the first two criteria but not the third, as it shares its orbit with other objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the Solar System beyond Neptune filled with many small, icy bodies. This inability to clear its orbit is what led to Pluto's reclassification as a dwarf planet.",
