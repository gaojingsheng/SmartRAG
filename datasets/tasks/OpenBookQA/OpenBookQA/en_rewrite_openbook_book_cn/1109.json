  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When salt is added to a liquid, the melting point of the liquid decreases. This phenomenon occurs because the dissolved salt disrupts the orderly arrangement of the liquid's molecules when they are freezing, making it harder for the liquid to solidify. As a result, the temperature at which the liquid freezes, or its melting point, is lowered.",
