  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A light source appears less bright the further away one gets from it due to the dispersion of light over a larger area. As the distance from the light source increases, the same amount of light spreads out over a greater area, reducing the intensity of light that reaches a specific point or observer. This phenomenon follows the inverse square law, which states that the intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Therefore, doubling the distance from a light source reduces its apparent brightness by a factor of four, making the light appear dimmer the further away one is.",
