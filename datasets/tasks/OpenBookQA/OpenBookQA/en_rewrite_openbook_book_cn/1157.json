  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A rainbow is created through the process of refraction when moisture is present in the atmosphere. This occurs as sunlight passes through water droplets. Essentially, each water droplet acts like a prism that disperses the incoming light into its constituent colors, which are the spectrum that people see as a rainbow. The refraction process bends the path of light and then separates it into a spectrum ranging from red to violet. Different wavelengths of light are bent by different amounts, with red light bending the least and violet the most. This dispersion of light into various colors leads to the formation of the circular arc of the rainbow that we observe in the sky.",
