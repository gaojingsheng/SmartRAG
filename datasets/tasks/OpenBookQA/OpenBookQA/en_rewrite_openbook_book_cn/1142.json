  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Deep lakes in regions formerly covered by ice sheets are primarily formed by glaciers through processes known as glacial erosion and retreat. When glaciers advance over land, they erode the soil and rock beneath them, carving out deep basins with their immense weight and the abrasive action of embedded rocks and sediments. As glaciers move, they sculpt the landscape beneath them, sometimes creating bowl-shaped depressions known as glacial cirques. When these glaciers eventually recede or melt, the basins they have carved fill with water, forming deep lakes. These processes can create a range of lake types, including ribbon lakes, which are long and narrow, and tarns, which are smaller lakes that form in cirques. The depth and shape of these lakes depend on the nature and extent of the glacial erosion and the topography of the bedrock.",
