  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The Appalachian Mountains were primarily formed through a geological process known as rock folding. This process occurs when the Earth's crust is subjected to intense pressure, causing layers of rock to fold and form mountainous structures. Essentially, the immense pressures and forces from tectonic plate movements push the rocks into folds, creating the ridges and peaks characteristic of the Appalachian Mountains. This process took place over millions of years and is a key factor in the complex geology and topography of this mountain range.",
