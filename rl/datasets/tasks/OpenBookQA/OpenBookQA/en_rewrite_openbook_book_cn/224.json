  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When an object is rubbed against another surface, the force opposing this motion is friction. Friction converts the kinetic energy of the rubbing action into heat energy, leading to an increase in the temperature of the objects involved. This temperature rise is a result of the energy transformation from the mechanical energy of moving objects into thermal energy, due to the interaction at the surfaces in contact.",
