  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The primary mechanism responsible for a vehicle's ability to come to a stop when the brakes are applied is friction. When the brake system is engaged, it creates friction between the vehicle's brake pads and rotors (or drums in some cases), which in turn slows down the rotation of the wheels, effectively reducing the vehicle's speed until it comes to a complete stop. This process involves converting the kinetic energy of the moving vehicle into heat energy due to the friction generated, which is dissipated into the atmosphere.",
