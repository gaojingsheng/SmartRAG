Other factors include adverse weather conditions (such as drought, frost, and floods), soil degradation (due to erosion, nutrient depletion, or salinization), diseases that affect crops or livestock, water scarcity, and inadequate agricultural practices (like overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, poor crop rotation, or suboptimal planting strategies). Each of these factors can reduce the yield and quality of agricultural produce, affecting food supply and farmers' incomes.",
