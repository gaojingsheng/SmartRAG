  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Objects with mass tend to move towards the surface of a planet due to the force of gravity. This force pulls objects toward the center of the planet, causing them to move downwards towards the surface. Every object that has mass exerts a gravitational pull on every other object with mass; the larger the mass of the object, the stronger its gravitational pull. Therefore, the planet, having a significantly larger mass compared to objects on its surface, exerts a strong gravitational pull that attracts objects towards it, compelling them to move in that direction.",
