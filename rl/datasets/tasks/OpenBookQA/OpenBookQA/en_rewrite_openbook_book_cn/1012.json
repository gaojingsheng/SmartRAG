  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Beads of water form on surfaces during humid conditions primarily through the process of condensation. This occurs when water vapor present in the air comes into contact with a cooler surface, causing the vapor to cool down and change back into liquid form. Since the surface is cooler than the dew point of the surrounding air, the excess moisture in the air condenses on it, forming tiny droplets or beads of water. This process is commonly observed on surfaces like glass, metal, and even plants, particularly during conditions of high humidity, where there is a significant amount of moisture present in the air.",
