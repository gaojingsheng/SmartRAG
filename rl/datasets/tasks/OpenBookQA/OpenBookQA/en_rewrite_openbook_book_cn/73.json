  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Spiders capture their food primarily by using their webs, intricately designed structures made from spider silk. These webs are strategically placed to intercept passing insects, such as flies, moths, and other small creatures. When these insects come into contact with the web, they get trapped in its sticky strands. The spider then detects the vibrations caused by the struggling prey, approaches it, and typically injects venom to immobilize it. Afterward, the spider may wrap the prey in silk for consumption later or eat it immediately. This method of capturing food is highly effective and allows spiders to secure meals with minimal effort.",
