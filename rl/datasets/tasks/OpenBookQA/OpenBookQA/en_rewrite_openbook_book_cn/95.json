  "ChatGPT_response_0": "One physiological behavior observed in animals to regulate their body temperature during hot weather conditions is panting. This process involves the animal hanging its tongue out of its mouth to cool down. Panting allows for the evaporation of water from the tongue, oral cavity, and upper respiratory tract, which helps in dissipating heat and lowering the body temperature. This behavior is especially common in dogs but can be observed in other animals as well.",
