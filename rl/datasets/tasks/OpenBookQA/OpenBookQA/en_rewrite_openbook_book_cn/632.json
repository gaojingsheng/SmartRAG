  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Colder regions tend to have a lower diversity of living species when compared to warmer areas primarily due to the more challenging living conditions that prevail in cold environments. These challenges include extreme temperatures, reduced availability of liquid water, and shorter growing seasons. In cold regions, the metabolic rates of organisms are generally lower, and the energy demands for maintaining bodily warmth can be significantly higher, narrowing the range of species that can effectively adapt and thrive under such conditions. Additionally, the limited availability of resources such as food and shelter further constrains biodiversity. In contrast, warmer areas typically offer a more stable environment with abundant energy and resources, supporting a wider range of life forms and fostering higher levels of biodiversity.",
