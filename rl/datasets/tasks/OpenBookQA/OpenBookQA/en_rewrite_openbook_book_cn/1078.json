  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Reptiles have a cold-blooded (ectothermic) system of blood regulation. This means they rely on external sources of temperature to regulate their body heat. Unlike warm-blooded animals that generate their own heat internally and maintain a constant body temperature regardless of the environment, reptiles must sunbathe to warm up and seek shade or go into water to cool down. Their metabolism and activity levels are directly influenced by the external temperature.",
