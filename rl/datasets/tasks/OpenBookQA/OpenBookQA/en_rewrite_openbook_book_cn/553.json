  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Oil is a type of resource that is classified as nonrenewable. This means that it is not replenished by natural processes within a human lifespan. The formation of oil takes millions of years, as it is created from the remains of ancient plants and animals that were buried under layers of sediment and subjected to intense heat and pressure over geological time scales. Therefore, the availability of oil is finite, and once current reserves are depleted, they cannot be quickly or easily replenished.",
