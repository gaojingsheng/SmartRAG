  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Limestone typically forms through the process of evaporation in environments where water contains dissolved minerals. As water evaporates, it leaves behind minerals that accumulate over time. These minerals, primarily calcium carbonate, precipitate out of the water solution and gradually form layers that compact and cement together, resulting in limestone. This process can occur in shallow marine environments such as coral reefs and seabeds, where the conditions are ideal for the formation of limestone due to the high concentration of calcium carbonate from the skeletal remains of marine organisms. Over geological time scales, the accumulating layers of calcium carbonate transform into solid limestone rock.",
