  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Wind is a type of renewable resource. This means it is an energy source that can replenish naturally over a short period of time and can be used again and again without the risk of depletion. This characteristic distinguishes it from non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels, which can take millions of years to form and are consumed faster than they are created. Wind energy is harnessed from the natural movement of air in the Earth's atmosphere and can be converted into electricity, making it a clean and sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources.",
