  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Animals use camouflage in their natural habitats primarily for two reasons: to protect themselves from predators and to assist them in hunting prey. Camouflage allows animals to blend in with their surroundings, making it harder for predators to spot and capture them. This survival strategy increases their chances of evading detection. Similarly, predators also employ camouflage to approach their prey without being noticed, enhancing their success in hunting. Through these means, camouflage serves as a critical adaptation for survival in the animal kingdom, ensuring both protection for prey species and hunting efficiency for predators.",
