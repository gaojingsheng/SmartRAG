  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Various factors can lead to the migration of wildlife from their natural habitats. One significant cause is natural disasters, such as wildfires, floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. These catastrophic events can destroy the habitats of animals, making it impossible for them to remain in their original locations. As a result, wildlife may be forced to migrate in search of new areas to live, find food, and reproduce. This movement is often a survival response to the immediate loss of shelter, food sources, and the broader ecosystem that supports their life cycles.",
