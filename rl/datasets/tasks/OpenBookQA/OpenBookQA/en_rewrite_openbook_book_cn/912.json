  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The formation of dew on surfaces outside during the nighttime occurs due to the cooling of water vapor in the air. When the air cools down overnight, its capacity to hold moisture decreases. This leads to the condensation of water vapor into liquid form, which then settles on cooler surfaces, forming dew. This process is most evident during clear, calm nights when the ground loses heat rapidly to the atmosphere via radiation, leading to a significant drop in temperature on the surface and facilitating the condensation of dew.",
