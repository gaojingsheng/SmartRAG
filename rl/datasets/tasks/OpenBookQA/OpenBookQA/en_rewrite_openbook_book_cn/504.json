  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A compass needle indicates direction during navigation because it aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth has magnetic poles, and the needle of a compass is magnetized, meaning one end will point toward the magnetic north pole and the other toward the magnetic south pole. When you hold a compass flat, the needle rotates until it aligns with these magnetic lines of force, allowing the user to identify directions (North, South, East, West) based on the needle's orientation. This alignment happens because the compass needle experiences a torque in the Earth's magnetic field, guiding it to point along the lines of the Earth's magnetic flux.",
