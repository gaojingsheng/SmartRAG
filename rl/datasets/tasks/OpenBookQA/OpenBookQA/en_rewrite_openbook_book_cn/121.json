  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A prism alters the path of light passing through it by causing the light to refract, which means it bends the light. This bending occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media, and when light enters the prism (which is a denser medium compared to air), its speed decreases. This change in speed at the interface of air and the prism causes the light to change direction. The extent of bending varies with the wavelength (color) of the light, causing different colors to spread out and form a spectrum. This phenomenon is responsible for the prism's ability to disperse white light into its constituent colors, such as in a rainbow.",
