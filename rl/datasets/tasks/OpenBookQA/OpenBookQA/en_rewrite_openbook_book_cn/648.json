  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Mice reproduce through a process called viviparity, meaning they give birth to live young. After a gestation period that typically lasts about 20 days, female mice give birth to a litter of pups. These offspring are born undeveloped, often hairless, with their eyes closed. The pups depend entirely on their mother for warmth and nutrition, relying on her milk for the first few weeks of life. As they grow, they gradually start to develop fur, open their eyes, and explore their surroundings, eventually weaning off of their mother's milk and starting to eat solid food. This critical period of development is marked by rapid growth and maturation, leading up to independence from the mother.",
