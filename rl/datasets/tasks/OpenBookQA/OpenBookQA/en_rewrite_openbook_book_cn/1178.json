This instinctual migration ensures that they lay their eggs in the same location where they were hatched, leveraging the safety and suitability of these environments for the development of their offspring. This behavior, known as homing, showcases the advanced navigation skills of salmon and their strong innate drive to ensure the survival of their species by selecting optimal conditions for the next generation.",
