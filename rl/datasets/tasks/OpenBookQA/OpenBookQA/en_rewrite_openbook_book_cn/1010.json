  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When an incandescent light bulb is turned on, it produces light through the conversion of electricity into light energy. This process occurs when electricity is sent through a filament inside the bulb. The filament, typically made of tungsten, heats up to extremely high temperatures as the electric current passes through it, causing it to glow and emit light. This light is what we see when the bulb is illuminated. The intense heat and light are due to the resistance the filament offers to the electric current, a principle known as resistance heating.",
