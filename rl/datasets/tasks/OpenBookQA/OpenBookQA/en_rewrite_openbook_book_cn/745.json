  "ChatGPT_response_0": "As one climbs a mountain, the air pressure decreases. This is because the density of the air, which is the number of air molecules in a given volume, reduces as the altitude increases. With fewer air molecules at higher elevations to exert force on a given area, the air pressure is lower compared to sea level or lower altitudes.",
