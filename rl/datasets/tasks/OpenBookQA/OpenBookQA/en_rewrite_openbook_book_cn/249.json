  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Milk is treated with the process of pasteurization before it is considered safe for consumption primarily to reduce the amount of harmful bacteria it contains. Pasteurization involves heating the milk to a specific temperature for a set period, then quickly cooling it down. This process effectively kills or inactivates many of the bacteria that can lead to foodborne illnesses, making the milk safer to drink. By significantly lowering the bacteria levels, pasteurization extends the shelf life of milk, ensuring it remains fresh for a longer period while maintaining its nutritional value. This method is crucial for public health, as consuming non-pasteurized milk could lead to serious health issues caused by bacteria such as Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria.",
