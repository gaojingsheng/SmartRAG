  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Breathing becomes more difficult at higher elevations primarily due to the decrease in air pressure. As you ascend a mountain, the atmosphere becomes less dense, containing fewer molecules, including oxygen, in any given volume of air. Consequently, with each breath you take, you inhale less oxygen than you would at sea level. This reduction in available oxygen makes it harder for your body to obtain the oxygen it needs, leading to the sensations of breathlessness and fatigue commonly experienced at high altitudes.",
