  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The geological process leading to the formation of a plateau often involves the buildup of cooled lava. This happens when lava flows out of cracks or vents in the earth's surface and then solidifies. Over time, repeated flows can build up layers of solid rock, gradually forming a raised, flat area known as a plateau. The process is typically associated with volcanic activity, where the effusive eruptions produce fluid lavas that spread out over large areas before cooling and solidifying.",
