  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Coal is classified as a nonrenewable resource due to its slow rate of formation compared to the rate at which it is being consumed. Nonrenewable resources are those that do not naturally replenish at a sufficient pace to keep up with human use within a human time scale. Coal forms over millions of years from the decomposed organic material under high pressure and heat, meaning once depleted, it cannot be readily replaced.",
