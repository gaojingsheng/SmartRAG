  "ChatGPT_response_0": "As the light source moves to a position directly above an object, the shadow cast by that object will become smaller. This happens because the angles at which light hits the object change, leading to a reduction in the shadow's footprint. Essentially, the closer the light source is to being directly overhead, the less elongated the shadow becomes, until it reaches its minimal size when the light is exactly overhead.",
