  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The phenomenon where you hear your voice repeated back to you in a large, empty room is caused by the effect known as an echo. An echo occurs when sound waves, like those produced by your voice, travel through the air and hit a surface, such as a wall or a distant barrier. Instead of being absorbed, these sound waves are reflected off the surface and then travel back to your ears. This process allows you to hear your voice as a repeated sound. The time delay and clarity of the echo are influenced by the distance between you and the reflecting surface, as well as the size of the room and its acoustical properties. In larger, emptier spaces, there are fewer objects to absorb the sound, making it easier for echoes to occur.",
