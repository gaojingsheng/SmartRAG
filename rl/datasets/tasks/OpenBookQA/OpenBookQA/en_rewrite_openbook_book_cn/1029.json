  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When rocks are subjected to high temperatures, the natural process that can lead to their degradation is thermal erosion. This process involves the gradual breakdown, weakening, or disintegration of rock materials due to the effects of heat. High temperatures can cause the minerals within rocks to expand at different rates, leading to mechanical stress and eventually causing the rock to crack, fragment, or crumble. Thermal erosion is a significant factor in the weathering of rocks in environments exposed to extreme heat, such as areas with frequent wildfires, near volcanic activity, or in desert climates where the temperature variation between day and night can be substantial.",
