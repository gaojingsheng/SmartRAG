  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Earth is primarily composed of rock, including both the solid ground we stand on and the deeper, denser materials that make up its interior. This composition forms the various geological layers of the Earth, including the crust (both continental and oceanic), the mantle, and the core, which is further divided into the solid inner core and the liquid outer core. The rocks that constitute Earth vary widely in composition and state, due to the planet's diverse geologic and tectonic processes.",
