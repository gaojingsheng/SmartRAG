  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Plants primarily utilize specialized tissues known as apical meristems, located at the tips of their stems, to increase their height. These meristems are regions of undifferentiated cells that have the capacity to divide and differentiate into various cell types. This process allows the plant to elongate upwards as these cells divide and grow, contributing to the plant's vertical growth.",
