  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The difference in solar energy received by different hemispheres of the Earth is primarily caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis. This axial tilt means that during various times of the year, one hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, receiving more direct sunlight and thus more solar energy, while the other hemisphere is tilted away, receiving less direct sunlight and consequently less solar energy. This variation in solar exposure leads to the seasonal changes experienced on Earth, with warmer summer months when a hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun and cooler winter months when it is tilted away.",
