  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The natural process that leads to the formation of valleys involves river erosion. As a river flows, it erodes the land over time, cutting a path through the terrain. This erosion process, which can take thousands or even millions of years, gradually carves out the land, forming a valley. The shape and depth of a valley depend on various factors, including the volume and speed of the water flowing through the river, the type of rock in the region (soft rocks erode more quickly than hard rocks), and the slope of the terrain.",
