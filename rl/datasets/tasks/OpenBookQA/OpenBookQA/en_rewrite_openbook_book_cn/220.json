  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A skunk defends itself against predators by producing a highly potent and offensive odor. This is achieved through the secretion of a foul-smelling spray from glands located near its tail. This defense mechanism is highly effective in deterring most would-be attackers, as the scent is not only unpleasant but can also cause irritation and temporary blindness, giving the skunk a chance to escape from predators.",
