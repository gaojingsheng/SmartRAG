  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Most cold environments are characterized by a white color primarily because they are blanketed in snow. Snow, consisting of ice crystals, reflects much of the sunlight that touches its surface, making these landscapes appear dominantly white to our eyes. This high reflectivity is due to the unique properties of the ice crystals, which scatter and reflect visible light in all directions, creating the white appearance we associate with snowy and icy environments.",
