  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Objects that are lighter in color appear more reflective than those that are darker because light-colored objects have a higher capacity to reflect light. This increased reflectivity is due to the inherent properties of lighter colors that enable them to bounce back a larger portion of the light spectrum when light hits their surface. In contrast, darker colors absorb more light, making them less reflective. This is why in environments with the same lighting conditions, a lighter-colored object will appear brighter and more reflective compared to a darker-colored object.",
