  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Aquatic animals have webbed feet to enhance their ability to move swiftly through the water. The webbing between their toes acts like a paddle, increasing the surface area of their feet. This allows them to push against the water more effectively with each stroke, translating into faster movement and improved maneuverability. Webbed feet are an evolutionary adaptation to aquatic life, making these animals more efficient swimmers in their water-based environments.",
