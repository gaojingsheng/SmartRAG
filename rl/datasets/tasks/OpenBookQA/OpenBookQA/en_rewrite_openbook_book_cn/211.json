  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Some animals adapt to high-temperature environments by developing the ability to sweat. Sweating is a physiological process where these animals release moisture (sweat) through their skin. As the sweat evaporates from the skin's surface, it effectively dissipates heat, reducing the body's temperature. This cooling mechanism is crucial for helping these animals maintain their internal body temperature within a safe range, thus allowing them to survive and function effectively in hot climates.",
