  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Objects fall toward the surface when dropped from a height on a planet because of the gravitational force. This force pulls objects that have mass towards the center of the planet, causing them to fall downward when they are not supported. The strength of this gravitational pull depends on the mass of the planet; larger planets exert a stronger gravitational force, causing objects to fall faster. This fundamental force of nature operates universally, affecting all objects with mass, whether on Earth or any other planet.",
