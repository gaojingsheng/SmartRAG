  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The perceived size of distant landmarks appears smaller to us than when we approach them due to the principle of visual perception known as perspective. When an object is far away, the visual angle it subtends on our retina is smaller compared to when it is close. The visual angle refers to the angle that an object appears to occupy in our field of vision, which directly influences our perception of its size. As we move closer to an object, the visual angle increases because the object takes up a greater portion of our visual field, making it appear larger. This is a basic principle of how our visual system interprets size based on the distance of objects from us.",
