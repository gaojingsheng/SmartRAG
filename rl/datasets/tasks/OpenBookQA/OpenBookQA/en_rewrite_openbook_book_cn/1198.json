  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When tectonic plates are pressed against each other, the resulting natural phenomenon is an earthquake. This happens because the stress accumulated from the plates pushing against each other eventually causes them to slip or move suddenly along faults, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of seismic waves, which we feel as an earthquake.",
