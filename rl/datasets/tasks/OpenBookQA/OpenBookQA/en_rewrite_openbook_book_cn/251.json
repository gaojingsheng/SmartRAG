  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Deer typically reside in forested habitats. These environments provide them with shelter, food sources such as leaves, twigs, fruits, and nuts, as well as protection from predators. Forests offer deer a variety of vegetation to browse on, and the dense trees and underbrush serve as excellent cover. Depending on the species and geographic location, deer can also adapt to live in other types of habitats, including grasslands, mountains, and even deserts, but forests are generally the most common and preferred habitat for many deer species.",
