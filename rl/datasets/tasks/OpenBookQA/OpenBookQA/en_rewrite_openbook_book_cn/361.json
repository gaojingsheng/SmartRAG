  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Continuous agricultural activities have a significant impact on soil nutrient levels, predominantly leading to a decrease in these essential resources. This occurs because plants absorb nutrients from the soil for growth, and when crops are harvested, these nutrients are removed from the soil system rather than being returned to it. Over time, the soil becomes less fertile, resulting in reduced crop yields. The issue is exacerbated by practices such as monoculture—cultivating the same crop year after year—which can deplete soil nutrients specific to the needs of that crop more rapidly. This nutrient depletion poses challenges for sustainable agricultural production, requiring interventions such as the application of chemical fertilizers, organic matter, or crop rotation to restore soil fertility and health.",
