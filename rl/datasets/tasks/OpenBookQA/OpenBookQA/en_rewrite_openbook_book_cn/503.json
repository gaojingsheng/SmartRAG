  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Solar energy is crucial to the water cycle, primarily via its role in heating Earth's surface water. When water bodies like oceans, rivers, and lakes absorb solar energy, this energy increases the temperature of the water. As the water warms, it evaporates, turning from liquid into vapor and rising into the atmosphere. This evaporation is a key process in the water cycle, as it contributes to the formation of clouds and eventually precipitation, which returns water to the surface in various forms such as rain or snow. Thus, solar energy not only initiates but also drives the continuous movement of water from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere and back, playing an essential role in weather patterns, climate, and the global distribution of water resources.",
