  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The reduction in moisture content of an object typically leads to an increase in the frictional interaction with another object. This happens because moisture can act as a lubricant at the interface between two surfaces, reducing the direct contact and thus the friction. As the moisture decreases, there is less lubrication, leading to more direct contact and therefore higher friction between the objects.",
