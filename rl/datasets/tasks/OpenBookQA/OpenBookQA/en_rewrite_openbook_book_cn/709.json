  "ChatGPT_response_0": "After an organism dies, it undergoes the natural process of decomposition. This involves the breakdown of its organic materials, often referred to as rotting. During this process, bacteria, fungi, and other decomposers play a crucial role in breaking down tissues and cells, recycling the organism back into the ecosystem by returning nutrients to the soil and atmosphere. Decomposition is an essential part of the natural cycle, ensuring that ecosystems remain healthy and nutrient-rich.",
