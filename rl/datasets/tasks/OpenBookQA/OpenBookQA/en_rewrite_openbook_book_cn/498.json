  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When the temperature of a liquid is raised, the rate of evaporation of that liquid increases. This happens because higher temperatures provide more energy to the liquid molecules, which increases their kinetic energy. As their kinetic energy increases, more molecules have enough energy to overcome the attractive forces holding them in the liquid and escape into the air as gas, thus increasing the rate of evaporation.",
