  "ChatGPT_response_0": "To reduce the rate at which heat moves between two objects, you would use a material known as a thermal insulator. Thermal insulators are designed to significantly slow down the transfer of heat, which makes them ideal for keeping heat in or out, depending on the application. Examples of such materials include foam, fiberglass, wool, and certain plastics. These materials have structures that trap air or other gases, effectively disrupting the heat flow.",
