  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When two objects are struck against each other, the impact causes the particles within those objects to vibrate. This vibration is a response to the energy transfer that occurs upon collision. Essentially, the kinetic energy from the motion of striking is transformed into vibrational energy within the materials' particles. This vibrational movement is a fundamental physical reaction to the impact, which may result in changes such as the production of sound or heat, depending on the characteristics of the objects and the intensity of the collision.",
