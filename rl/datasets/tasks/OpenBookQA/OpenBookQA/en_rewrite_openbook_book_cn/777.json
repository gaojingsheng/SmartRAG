  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Caverns in limestone regions are typically formed through a process where carbonic acid present in groundwater seeps through rock crevices. Over time, this acid dissolves the limestone, gradually enlarging the cracks and fissures. Eventually, this leads to the creation of underground caverns. The process is a part of what is known as chemical weathering, where water mixed with carbon dioxide from the air or soil forms a weak carbonic acid. This naturally occurring acid is particularly effective at dissolving the calcium carbonate in limestone, leading to the formation of spacious caverns and intricate cave systems.",
