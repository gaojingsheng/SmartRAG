  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The variation in temperature during daytime hours plays a significant role in determining the overall temperature of a given environment. As the sun rises and its intensity increases throughout the day, it leads to an increase in temperature. This is because the sun's rays provide heat energy that warms the air, surfaces, and objects. Consequently, the environment's temperature rises in response to the heightened solar energy it receives during daylight hours. This process is a primary driver behind the daily temperature fluctuations and significantly influences the environmental conditions experienced throughout the day.",
