  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Certain marine animals achieve high speeds when swimming in the ocean by utilizing large fins. These fins act as powerful propellers or paddles, enabling the animals to push against the water with significant force. The streamlined shapes of these animals reduce resistance, allowing them to move swiftly through their aquatic environments. This combination of large, efficient fins and streamlined bodies is key to their ability to reach high speeds underwater.",
