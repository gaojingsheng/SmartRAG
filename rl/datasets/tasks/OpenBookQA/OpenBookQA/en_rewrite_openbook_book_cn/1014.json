  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Objects placed outside during a sunny day become warm to the touch due to the absorption of solar energy from the sunlight. When sunlight, which contains a wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation including visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation, hits an object, some of that light's energy is absorbed by the object. This absorption process increases the internal energy of the object, leading to a rise in its temperature. Consequently, when you touch the object, it feels warm because it has absorbed and retained heat from the sunlight.",
