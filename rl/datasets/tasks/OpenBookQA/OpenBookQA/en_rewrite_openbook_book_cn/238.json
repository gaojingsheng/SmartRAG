  "ChatGPT_response_0": "As glaciers melt, they often create piles of rocks through a process known as deposition. When glaciers move, they transport rocks and sediment frozen within them. As the ice melts, these materials are deposited, creating mounds or piles. These rock piles can vary in size and are found in areas previously covered by glaciers, marking the paths where these massive ice bodies once flowed.",
