  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The temperature of a planet orbiting a star is primarily determined by its distance from that star. The closer a planet is to its star, the more heat it receives, and consequently, the warmer it tends to be. This heating occurs because the planet absorbs the star's light and radiation, which is then converted into heat energy within the planet's atmosphere and surface, if it has one. Other factors that can influence a planet's temperature include its atmospheric composition, which can trap heat and create a greenhouse effect, and its albedo, or the reflectivity of the planet's surface, which determines how much of the star's light is absorbed versus reflected back into space. Additionally, a planet's internal heat sources, such as geothermal or tidal heating, can also play a role in its overall temperature.",
