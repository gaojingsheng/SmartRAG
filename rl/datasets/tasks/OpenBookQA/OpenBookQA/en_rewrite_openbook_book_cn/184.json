  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The process that leads to the formation of liquid from a gaseous state is called condensation. This process involves the cooling of the gas, which reduces its energy and allows the molecules to come closer together, transitioning from a gaseous to a liquid state. Condensation occurs when the temperature of the gas drops to or below its dew point, or when the gas comes into contact with a surface that is at a lower temperature than the dew point of the gas. This change of state is essential in various natural and industrial processes, such as the formation of dew and the operation of refrigeration systems.",
