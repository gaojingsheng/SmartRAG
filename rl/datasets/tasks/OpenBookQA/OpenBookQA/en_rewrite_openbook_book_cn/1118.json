  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When a vapor cools down, it undergoes the process of condensation. This occurs when the temperature of the vapor decreases to a point where it can no longer remain in the gaseous state. As the vapor cools, its molecules lose energy and move closer together, transitioning from a gaseous phase back into a liquid state. This change of state releases heat into the surrounding environment. Condensation is commonly observed on surfaces like the outside of a cold glass of water, where water vapor from the air cools down and becomes liquid water on the glass surface.",
