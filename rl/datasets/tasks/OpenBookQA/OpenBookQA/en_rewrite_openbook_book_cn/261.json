  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Some rock formations in areas that were previously covered by glaciers occur due to the process of glacial deposition. As glaciers move and retreat, they melt and release the rocks and debris they have been carrying. These materials are then deposited on the landscape, often piling up to form various rock formations. This process can lead to the creation of features such as moraines, which are accumulations of dirt and rocks that have been pushed and deposited by a moving glacier.",
