  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When an object starts moving from a stationary position, its energy transformation involves the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy. Where the object previously had stored energy due to its position or state, this energy is then converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy it possesses due to its motion. This process refers to the fundamental principle of energy conservation, where energy cannot be created or destroyed but can change from one form to another.",
