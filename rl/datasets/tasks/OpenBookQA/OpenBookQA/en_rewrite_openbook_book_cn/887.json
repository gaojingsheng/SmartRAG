  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The strength of the gravitational pull experienced on a planet's surface is primarily determined by the mass of the planet itself. The greater the mass of the planet, the stronger its gravitational pull will be. This fundamental principle explains why objects weigh more on larger planets with greater mass than on smaller, less massive ones.",
