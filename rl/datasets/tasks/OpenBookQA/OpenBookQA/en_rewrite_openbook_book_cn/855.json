  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Sedimentary rocks are formed through the accumulation and compaction of sediment. This process begins when weathering and erosion break down rocks into smaller particles such as sand, silt, clay, or pebbles. These sediments are then transported by wind, water, or ice and deposited in layers in various environments such as rivers, lakes, or ocean floors. Over time, the weight of additional layers of sediment compresses the lower layers, causing them to compact and solidify into rock. This process, known as lithification, transforms loose sediment into sedimentary rock.",
