  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The physical principle explaining the acceleration of an object's velocity when an external influence is applied is Newton's Second Law of Motion. This law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to its mass. In essence, when a force is applied to an object, it causes the object to accelerate, thus changing its velocity. This acceleration is in the direction of the applied force.",
