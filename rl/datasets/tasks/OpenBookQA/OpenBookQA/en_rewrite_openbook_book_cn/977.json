  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When a person is riding a bicycle, the action that causes it to move forward is the pushing on the pedals. This pedaling action transfers human effort into mechanical movement. As the rider pushes down on the pedals, this force is transferred through the bike's drive mechanism, typically a chain and gears, which in turn rotates the wheels, propelling the bicycle forward.",
