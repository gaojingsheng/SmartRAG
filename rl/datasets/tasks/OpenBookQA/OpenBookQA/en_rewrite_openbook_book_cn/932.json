  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The biological process that describes how a female of a species produces her young is known as parturition or birthing. This process involves the mother carrying the offspring during a gestation period and eventually giving birth, where the young are expelled from the mother's body, marking the end of pregnancy and the beginning of external life for the offspring. Different species have varying methods and durations of gestation, but the fundamental concept of birthing remains consistent across the animal kingdom as the process through which a mother produces and delivers her young.",
