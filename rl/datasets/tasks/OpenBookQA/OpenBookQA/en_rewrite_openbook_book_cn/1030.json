  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Cycles of freeze-thaw contribute to the process of ice wedging by exploiting the natural expansion of water as it freezes. When water seeps into cracks or pores within rocks and the temperature drops below freezing, the water expands as it turns into ice. This expansion applies pressure to the surrounding rock, gradually prying the rock apart. As the temperature rises and the ice melts, the water may penetrate deeper into the newly widened cracks. With each subsequent freeze, the process repeats, further expanding the cracks and leading to the gradual disintegration of the rock. This natural process is a significant factor in weathering, contributing to the breakdown of rocks and the formation of soil.",
