  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The change in seasons on Earth is caused by its orbit around the Sun. As the Earth travels in its elliptical orbit, the tilt of its axis also plays a crucial role. This tilt (approximately 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun) causes different parts of Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences summer due to more direct sunlight, while the Southern Hemisphere, being tilted away, experiences winter due to less direct sunlight, and vice versa. This variation in sunlight and solar radiation leads to changes in weather patterns and temperatures, creating the different seasons experienced throughout the year.",
