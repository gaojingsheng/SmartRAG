  "ChatGPT_response_0": "For coral to thrive, it requires a marine habitat, typically found in clear, shallow waters where sunlight can easily penetrate. These conditions are essential for the photosynthetic algae, known as zooxanthellae, that live in the coral's tissues and provide the coral with nutrients. The optimal temperature range for most coral species is between 68°F and 82°F (20°C to 28°C). Coral reefs also prefer areas with strong waves or currents, which bring in fresh nutrients and oxygen while removing waste products. Additionally, corals need clean, sediment-free water because too much sediment can smother them. Salinity levels should be stable, with most coral species thriving in salinity levels of 34 to 37 parts per thousand.",
