  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The reason objects get warmer when left out in direct sunlight is due to the absorption of sunlight. Sunlight consists of energy, and when this energy strikes an object, it's absorbed and converted into heat. This process increases the object's temperature, making it feel warmer to the touch. Essentially, the sunlight's energy directly impacts the object's molecules, causing them to vibrate more vigorously, which manifests as heat.",
