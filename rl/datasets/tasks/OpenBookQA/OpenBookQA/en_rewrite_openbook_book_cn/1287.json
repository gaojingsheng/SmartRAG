  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The natural process responsible for warming the Earth's surface is the greenhouse effect, which is initiated by sunlight. When sunlight reaches Earth, it is absorbed by the surface, heating it. This heat is then radiated back towards space as infrared radiation. Some of this infrared radiation is absorbed and re-radiated in all directions by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, warming the Earth's surface and the lower atmosphere. This process is essential for maintaining the Earth's temperature at a level suitable for life.",
