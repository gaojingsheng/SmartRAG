  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The fizz in a soda drink is caused by dissolved carbon dioxide. When the soda is bottled or canned, carbon dioxide is forced into it under high pressure, which allows more of the gas to dissolve into the liquid than under normal atmospheric conditions. Once the soda is opened and the pressure is released, the carbon dioxide gas starts to escape, forming the bubbles that create the fizz. This effervescence is a key characteristic of carbonated beverages and is responsible for the tingly sensation you feel when drinking them.",
