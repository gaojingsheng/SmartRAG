  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Mice reproduce through a process where the female becomes pregnant after mating with a male and goes through a gestational period, which lasts about 19 to 21 days. During this time, the fertilized eggs develop into embryos and then mature into live young inside the female. Unlike some other species that lay eggs, mice give birth to live offspring. This viviparous nature means that the young are born fully formed, although they are still very small and their eyes are closed. The newborn mice, known as pups, depend on their mother for warmth and nutrition through her milk. They usually start to open their eyes about two weeks after birth and are weaned at around three to four weeks old. Mouse litters can vary in size, typically consisting of five to six pups, but it's not uncommon for a litter to have more than a dozen offspring, depending on the species and environmental conditions.",
