  "ChatGPT_response_0": "An example of a physical process where a liquid turns into a vapor by absorbing heat from its surroundings is evaporation, such as when a body of water gradually dries up as it absorbs heat energy from its environment. This process involves the transformation of water from its liquid state into a gaseous state, or vapor, which then disperses into the air. This transition typically occurs at the surface of the liquid, and it doesn't require the liquid to reach its boiling point. Instead, the energy absorbed from the surroundings increases the kinetic energy of the surface molecules, allowing them to escape into the air as vapor.",
