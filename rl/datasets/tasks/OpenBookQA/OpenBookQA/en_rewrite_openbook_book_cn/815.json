  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Materials utilized to reduce the speed of electrical conductivity are known as electrical insulators. These materials are specifically designed to impede the flow of electricity, thereby slowing or entirely blocking the movement of electrical charges. Electrical insulators are made from a wide range of materials, including glass, plastic, rubber, air, and certain ceramics. Each of these materials possesses a high resistance to electrical current, making them ideal for preventing unwanted flow of electricity and ensuring safety in electrical systems.",
