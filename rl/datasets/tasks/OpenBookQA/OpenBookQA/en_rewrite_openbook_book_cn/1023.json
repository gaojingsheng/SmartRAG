  "ChatGPT_response_0": "In an ecosystem, an organism that primarily breaks down dead material and recycles nutrients back into the environment plays the role of a decomposer. Decomposers are crucial for the health and sustainability of ecosystems because they help in the breakdown of dead organisms and the recycling of nutrients, making these nutrients available for uptake by plants and other producers. This role supports the foundation of the food web by ensuring that essential minerals and elements are returned to the soil and water, where they can be reused by autotrophs (organisms that produce their own food), thus maintaining the ecosystem's nutrient cycle. Examples of decomposers include fungi, bacteria, and certain types of insects and worms.",
