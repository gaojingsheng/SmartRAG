  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When light encounters a reflective object, it undergoes a process called reflection. This means that the light rays bounce off the surface of the object rather than being absorbed or transmitted through it. The angle at which the light hits the surface, known as the angle of incidence, is equal to the angle at which it reflects away from the surface, called the angle of reflection. This behavior of light is what allows us to see images in mirrors and other reflective surfaces.",
