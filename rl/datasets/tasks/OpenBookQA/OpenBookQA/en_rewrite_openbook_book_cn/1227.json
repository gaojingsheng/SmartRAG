  "ChatGPT_response_0": "White blood cells (WBCs) are crucial components of the body's immune system, tasked with defending the body against both infectious diseases and foreign invaders. Their primary function is to identify, target, and eliminate pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and other organisms that can cause illness. They play a central role in the immune response by directly attacking invaders, producing antibodies, and coordinating with other components of the immune system to mount an effective defense. This action helps the body to not only address current infections but also build immunity against future attacks by the same pathogens.",
