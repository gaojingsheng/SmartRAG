  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Mountain ranges like the Alps were originally formed through a geological process known as rock folding. This process occurs when the Earth's tectonic plates move and push against each other. The intense pressure and heat generated cause the rocks at the boundaries of these plates to deform and fold, creating mountainous structures. Over millions of years, these folds can rise to form significant mountain ranges, such as the Alps, due to the continued pressure and movement of the Earth's crust.",
