  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Metal objects feel colder to the touch than wooden objects at the same temperature because metals are good thermal conductors. This means that when you touch a metal object, it efficiently transfers heat away from your skin faster than a wooden object would. Since heat transfer is more efficient with metals, your skin cools down more quickly upon contact, making the metal feel colder. In contrast, wood is a poor conductor of heat, meaning it does not transfer heat as efficiently as metal does, so it feels warmer to the touch. Essentially, the feeling of temperature is influenced by the rate of heat transfer between your skin and the material, not just the actual temperature of the objects.",
