  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The environmental process that can lead to the degradation of rocks when they are subjected to high temperatures is thermal erosion. When rocks are exposed to high temperatures, it can lead to significant changes in their structure and composition. The extreme heat may cause the minerals within the rocks to expand at different rates, leading to internal stresses that can cause the rock to crack, flake, or even break apart. Over time, this process of expansion, stress, and material breakage contributes to the overall erosion and degradation of the rock structure.",
