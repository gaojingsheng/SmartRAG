  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Amphibians experience a biological process called metamorphosis, involving significant changes in their body structure as they develop from larvae to adult form. This complex transformation includes the reorganization of body structures and functions, allowing amphibians to transition from an aquatic lifestyle in their larval stage to a primarily terrestrial existence as adults. During metamorphosis, amphibians undergo various morphological changes such as the development of limbs, the loss or modification of tail, the formation of lungs for breathing air, and changes in skin composition to adapt to their new environment. This process enables them to exploit different ecological niches throughout their life cycle.",
