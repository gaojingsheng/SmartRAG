  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The primary function of a greenhouse in the cultivation of plants is to provide a controlled environment that protects the plants from extreme weather conditions, particularly cold. By trapping heat from the sun, the greenhouse maintains a warmer temperature than the outside environment, which is crucial for the growth of plants that are not suited to the colder local climate. This warmth enables gardeners and farmers to grow a wider variety of plants throughout the year and can help in starting seedlings early in the season before outdoor temperatures are suitable.",
