  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A compass determines direction by using the Earth's natural magnetism. Inside the compass is a magnetic needle that is freely suspended and aligned with the Earth's magnetic field. This alignment causes one end of the needle, typically marked and often referred to as the \"north\" end, to point towards the Earth's magnetic north pole. This allows users to determine the cardinal directions—north, south, east, and west—based on the orientation of the needle. The Earth's magnetism acts as a guiding force for the compass needle, making the compass an essential tool for navigation.",
