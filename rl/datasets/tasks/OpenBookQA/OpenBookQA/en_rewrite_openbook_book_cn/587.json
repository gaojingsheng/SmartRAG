  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Objects made of glass change the direction of light passing through them due to a phenomenon called refraction. Refraction occurs when light travels from one medium into another of different density, causing the light waves to bend. Since glass is denser than air, when light moves from air into glass, its speed decreases, and as a result, the light wave changes direction. The extent to which the light bends depends on the angle at which it enters the glass, as well as the physical properties of the glass itself. This bending of light is why objects viewed through glass can appear distorted or shifted from their original position.",
