  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The primary reason for the increase in Earth's average temperature over time is due to an imbalance between the amount of energy the Earth absorbs from the sun and the amount it loses back into space. When the Earth absorbs more energy than it loses, this leads to a net gain in heat, resulting in an increase in the average global temperature. This imbalance is primarily driven by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, effectively trapping more heat and contributing to global warming.",
