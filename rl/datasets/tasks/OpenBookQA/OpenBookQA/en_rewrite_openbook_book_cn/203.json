  "ChatGPT_response_0": "An item is defined as being reusable if it has the capability to be used multiple times for its intended purpose without significant degradation in function, performance, or safety. This means that after its initial use, it can be cleaned, repaired if necessary, and then used again repeatedly, often for the same function it was originally designed for. Reusability not only implies physical durability but also encompasses the item's ability to retain its usefulness over multiple uses, thereby reducing the need for disposable alternatives and contributing to sustainable practices.",
