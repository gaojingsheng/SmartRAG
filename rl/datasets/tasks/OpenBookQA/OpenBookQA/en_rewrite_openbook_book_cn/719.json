These essential nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and various other minerals, support various functions of the plant, from root development to photosynthesis. The availability of these nutrients in the soil allows plants to grow, reproduce, and carry out necessary life processes. Additionally, the soil offers physical support to plants, anchoring their root systems and facilitating water uptake along with nutrient absorption.",
