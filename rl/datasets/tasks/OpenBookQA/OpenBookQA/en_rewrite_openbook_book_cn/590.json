  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Octopuses employ a defense mechanism where they expel ink into the water around them. This ink serves as a smokescreen that can confuse and deter predators, giving the octopus a chance to escape. The ink cloud can also mask the scent of the octopus, further aiding in its evasion from potential threats.
