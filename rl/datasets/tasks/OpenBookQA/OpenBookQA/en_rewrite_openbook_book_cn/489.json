  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When solids are subjected to temperatures higher than their designated melting point, they undergo a phase transition from the solid state to the liquid state. This process, known as melting, involves the solid absorbing heat energy, which increases the motion of its molecules. As the temperature rises to the melting point, the molecules have enough energy to overcome the forces holding them together in the solid arrangement. Consequently, the solid begins to lose its rigid, fixed shape and transforms into a liquid, which has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container. This transition happens because the molecules can move more freely past one another, allowing the material to flow.",
