  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When heat energy is added to a solid, causing it to transform into a liquid, the process occurring is called melting. This phenomenon involves the absorption of heat by the solid, leading to an increase in the kinetic energy of its particles. As the particles move faster, they overcome the forces holding them together in a solid structure, resulting in the substance transitioning into a liquid state.",
