  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Rocks found in riverbeds typically have smoother surfaces compared to those in upland areas because they are subjected to continuous contact with other rocks, water, and sediment as the river flows. This constant abrasion over long periods gradually wears down the sharp edges and rough surfaces of these rocks, making them smoother. The process is similar to sandpapering a rough surface; the longer and more consistent the action, the smoother the surface becomes. In contrast, rocks in upland areas might not experience the same level of consistent, abrasive forces and thus tend to retain more of their original roughness and sharp edges.",
