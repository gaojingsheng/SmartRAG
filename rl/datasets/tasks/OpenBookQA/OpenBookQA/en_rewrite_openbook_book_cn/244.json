  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The Lamarckian theory, proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, explains the development and transmission of traits in organisms through the principle of use and disuse and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. According to this theory, if an organism uses a particular organ or part extensively during its lifetime, that part becomes more developed. Conversely, organs or parts that are not used deteriorate. These changes, known as acquired characteristics, are then thought to be inherited by the organism's offspring. For example, Lamarck famously suggested that giraffes have long necks because their ancestors stretched their necks to reach leaves in tall trees, and this characteristic was passed on to future generations. This theory contrasts with Darwinian evolution, which relies on natural selection and does not support the inheritance of acquired characteristics.",
