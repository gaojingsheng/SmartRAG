  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The proximity of a location to the North Pole significantly influences the amount of daylight it receives during the winter months. As a location moves closer to the North Pole, it experiences a decrease in daylight hours during these months. This phenomenon occurs due to the tilt of the Earth on its axis, which, during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, results in the North Pole being angled away from the Sun. Consequently, regions closer to the North Pole have shorter days and longer nights, leading to reduced daylight exposure. Conversely, locations further from the North Pole experience relatively more daylight during the same period.",
