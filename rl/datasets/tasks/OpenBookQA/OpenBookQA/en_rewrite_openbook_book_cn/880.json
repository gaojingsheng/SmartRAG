  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The color of a person's eyes is determined by genetics. It is an inherited characteristic that depends on the combination of genes received from both parents. Different genes contribute to the specific shade and pattern of the iris, which can range from very light blue to dark brown. The variation in eye color among individuals is primarily due to the amount and distribution of melanin, a type of pigment, in the iris. The more melanin present, the darker the eye color; conversely, less melanin results in lighter eye colors.",
