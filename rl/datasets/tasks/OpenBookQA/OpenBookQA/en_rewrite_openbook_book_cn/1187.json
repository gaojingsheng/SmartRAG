  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A rocket engine generates the necessary force to propel a rocket forward through the principle of action and reaction, as described by Newton's third law of motion: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is achieved by expelling gas at high speed in one direction, which, in turn, produces a force that pushes the rocket in the opposite direction. This expulsion of gas and the resulting thrust enable the rocket to move forward. The faster the gas is expelled, the greater the amount of thrust, or forward force, is generated, facilitating the rocket’s ascent.",
