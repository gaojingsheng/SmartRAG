  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When the energy derived from food is not immediately utilized by the body, it is converted into and stored in different forms for future use. Primarily, this energy is stored as fat in adipose tissue or as glycogen in the liver and muscles. Glycogen serves as a quickly accessible energy source for short-term needs, while fat storage provides a more dense energy reserve for longer-term needs. This process ensures the body has a continuous supply of energy between meals or during fasting periods.",
