  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A surface becomes harder to slide on as its texture becomes more uneven because the increased roughness leads to a rise in friction. This is because when a surface is uneven, there are more points of contact where the surface can interlock or resist movement against another object sliding over it. Consequently, more force is required to overcome the resistance and initiate or maintain sliding, thereby making the surface harder to slide on.",
