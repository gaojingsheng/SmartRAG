  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Inherited characteristics are transferred from parents to their offspring through genes. These genes act as a vehicle, carrying the genetic information responsible for various traits from both the mother and the father to the child. Each parent contributes half of the genes received by the offspring, thereby influencing physical traits, susceptibility to certain diseases, and even some behaviors. The combination of these genes determines the unique set of characteristics displayed by the offspring.",
