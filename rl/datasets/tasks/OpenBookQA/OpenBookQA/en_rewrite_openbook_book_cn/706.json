  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When a liquid reaches its boiling point, it undergoes a phase transition from liquid to gas. This is characterized by the formation of bubbles within the liquid that rise to the surface and escape into the air as vapor. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure acting on the liquid's surface. Essentially, at this point, the liquid becomes hot enough that its molecules have enough energy to overcome the atmospheric pressure and enter the gaseous phase.",
