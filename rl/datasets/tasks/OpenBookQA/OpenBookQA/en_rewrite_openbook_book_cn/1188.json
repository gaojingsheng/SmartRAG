  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Objects feel hot to the touch when they are heated because the heat increases the temperature of the object's surfaces. This rise in temperature means that the molecules in the object are moving more rapidly. When you touch a hot object, the thermal energy (or heat) transfers from the object to your skin, primarily through conduction. This energy transfer causes the temperature of your skin to increase in the area of contact, which your nerve endings detect as heat, leading to the sensation that the object is hot.",
