  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The primary purpose of a seed in the life cycle of a plant is to facilitate the reproduction and dispersal of the species. A seed contains a new plant (embryo) in a dormant state along with the necessary nutrients (stored food) it needs to start growing. When the seed finds itself in the right conditions—such as the appropriate temperature, moisture, and soil—this stored food supports the initial growth phase of the embryo as it develops into a seedling, eventually growing into a mature plant that can reproduce and continue the cycle.",
