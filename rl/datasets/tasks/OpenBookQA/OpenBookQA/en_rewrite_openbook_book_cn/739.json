  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Days feel shorter during the winter season primarily due to the shorter duration of daylight. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt of its axis causes variations in the angle at which sunlight reaches different parts of the planet throughout the year. During winter in a hemisphere (northern or southern), the tilt is such that the Sun's path across the sky is lower, resulting in shorter days and longer nights. This decrease in daylight hours gives the impression that days are shorter during the winter months.",
