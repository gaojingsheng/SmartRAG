  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The primary geological process responsible for the formation of mountains is plate tectonics. This process involves the movement and interaction of the Earth's lithospheric plates, which can lead to the uplift of the Earth's surface to form mountain ranges. There are several mechanisms through plate tectonics that can lead to mountain formation, including the collision of continental plates, which can create high mountain ranges such as the Himalayas, and the subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental plate, which can also result in mountain building along continental margins.",
