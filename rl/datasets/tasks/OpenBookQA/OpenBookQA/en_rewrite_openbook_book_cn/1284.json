  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The natural process responsible for the formation of scratches on the surfaces of rocks in areas previously covered by ice is caused by glaciers. As glaciers move slowly over the land, they pick up rocks and debris. These embedded materials act like the rough surface of a file or sandpaper. When the glacier flows over the bedrock, these materials grind against the underlying surface, etching scratches and grooves into the rock. This process is a part of glacial erosion and leaves behind characteristic marks known as striations that tell the story of past glacial movements.",
