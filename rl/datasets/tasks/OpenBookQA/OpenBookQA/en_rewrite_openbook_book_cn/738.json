  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Matter in the gas phase exhibits a variable shape, which differentiates it markedly from liquids and solids. This attribute means that gases do not have a fixed shape but instead expand to fill the shape of their container. Unlike solids that maintain a definite shape and volume, or liquids that have a definite volume but take the shape of their container, gases freely change both shape and volume to fully occupy the space they are in. This characteristic is due to the high kinetic energy of gas particles, which move rapidly and are widely spaced, allowing the gas to spread out until it uniformly fills the container.",
