  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The coat color of an animal is determined by its genetics. Specifically, the color of an animal's fur is an inherited characteristic, passed down from its parents to their offspring. This means that the specific genes an animal inherits from its parents directly influence the color of its fur. These genes are responsible for the production and distribution of pigments in the fur, which in turn determine the color and patterns seen in the animal's coat. Different genes and combinations thereof can lead to a wide variety of coat colors and patterns within a species.",
