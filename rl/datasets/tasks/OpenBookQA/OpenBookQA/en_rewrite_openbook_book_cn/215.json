  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When an object experiences two forces of equal magnitude but in opposite directions, it remains stationary. This is because the forces cancel each other out, resulting in no net force acting on the object. With no net force, the object does not accelerate and thus maintains its state of motion or rest according to Newton's first law of motion, also known as the principle of inertia.",
