  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Plastic is considered a nonrenewable resource. This categorization is based on the fact that plastics are primarily derived from fossil fuels, such as oil and natural gas, which are finite resources formed over millions of years beneath the Earth's surface. Unlike renewable resources, which can replenish themselves within a human lifespan, once the existing fossil fuel reserves are depleted, they cannot be replaced within a comparable timeframe. This characteristic defines plastics and their raw material sources as nonrenewable.",
