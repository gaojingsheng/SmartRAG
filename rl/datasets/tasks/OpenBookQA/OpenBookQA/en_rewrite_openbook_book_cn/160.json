  "ChatGPT_response_0": "The primary reason for food spoilage in storage conditions is the growth of microorganisms, including bacteria, molds, and yeasts. These organisms thrive on food products, leading to their deterioration and spoilage through processes such as fermentation, rancidity, and the breakdown of food's physical structure. Factors such as temperature, moisture levels, and the presence of oxygen can significantly influence the rate at which these microorganisms grow, affecting the shelf life and safety of stored food products.",
