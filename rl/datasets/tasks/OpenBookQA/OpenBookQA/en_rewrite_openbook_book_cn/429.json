  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When you plug an electrical device into a wall socket, you complete an electrical circuit. This allows electric current to flow through the device, enabling it to operate or charge. The wall socket is connected to your home's electrical wiring, which is in turn connected to the local power grid. So, by completing the circuit, you're effectively connecting the device to a larger network of electricity that powers it.",
