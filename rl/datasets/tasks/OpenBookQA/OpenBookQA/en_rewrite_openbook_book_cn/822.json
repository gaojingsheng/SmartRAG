  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When the sky is described as cloudy, it indicates that clouds are covering a significant portion of the sky. Clouds can vary in density and type, affecting the amount of sunlight that filters through. This condition can lead to a range of visual appearances from a fully overcast sky, limiting sunlight, to a sky dotted with clouds allowing for partial sunlight. Cloudy skies are often associated with cooler temperatures and can be a precursor to various weather conditions such as rain or storms, depending on the cloud type and other weather factors.",
