  "ChatGPT_response_0": "One of the major impacts of inclement weather on driving conditions is the significant decrease in visibility. During poor weather conditions, such as rain, fog, snow, or dust storms, drivers may find it difficult to see the road ahead, other vehicles, and road signs clearly. This reduced visibility can increase the risk of accidents as it becomes harder for drivers to judge distances and react in time to obstacles or changes in traffic. Therefore, driving in bad weather demands extra caution and slower speeds to ensure safety.",
