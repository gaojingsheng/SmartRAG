  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Carbohydrates are composed of sugar molecules, which include single sugar units (monosaccharides) and compounds of multiple sugar units (such as disaccharides and polysaccharides). These sugars contain elements of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically in a ratio of 1:2:1. The basic building blocks of carbohydrates are therefore these sugar molecules, which can vary in structure and complexity from simple sugars like glucose to complex starches and dietary fiber found in many plants.",
