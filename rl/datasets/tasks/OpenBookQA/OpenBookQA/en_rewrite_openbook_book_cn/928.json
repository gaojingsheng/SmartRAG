  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Wood is commonly used as a handle for tools and equipment that might come into contact with electrical wires because it serves as an electrical insulator. This means that it does not conduct electrical current effectively, providing a layer of safety by preventing electricity from flowing through the tool to the user. This insulating property helps to protect individuals from electrical shocks, making wooden handles a preferred choice for safety in situations where electrical contact is a possibility.",
