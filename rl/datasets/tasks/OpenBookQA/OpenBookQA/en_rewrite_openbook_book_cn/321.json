  "ChatGPT_response_0": "A significant environmental consequence of using oil as an energy source is that its combustion releases pollutants into the atmosphere. These pollutants can include harmful gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and climate change. Additionally, burning oil can emit sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, which are detrimental to air quality and can lead to respiratory problems in humans as well as damage to ecosystems. These pollutants not only pose a threat to environmental sustainability and public health but also contribute to acid rain, which can harm wildlife and degrade buildings and monuments.",
