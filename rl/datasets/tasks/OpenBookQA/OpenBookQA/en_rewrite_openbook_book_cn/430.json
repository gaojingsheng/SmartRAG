  "ChatGPT_response_0": "Stars change their position in the sky over the course of a night due to the Earth's rotation on its axis. As the Earth rotates from west to east, stars appear to move from east to west across the sky. This motion is relative to the horizon, and it's why different stars and constellations can be observed at various times throughout the night. This apparent movement is most noticeable during a clear night when stars and constellations rise in the east, move across the sky, and set in the west, mirroring the Sun's path during the day but on a stellar scale.",
