  "ChatGPT_response_0": "When you engage in activities that demand more energy, such as running, cycling, or even climbing stairs, your pulse rate increases. This happens because your body needs more oxygen and nutrients to supply the muscles that are working harder. As a result, your heart beats faster to pump more blood, which carries oxygen and the necessary nutrients, to those muscles. This increased circulation helps meet the energy demands of your activity, resulting in an elevated pulse rate.",
